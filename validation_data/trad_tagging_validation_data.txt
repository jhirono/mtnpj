input: Rack: set of nuts, many cams from Camalot .5 to 2.  Two bolt anchor at top.
output: standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: Gear to 2 inches.  Two-bolt anchor on top.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Gear to 2 or 2.5 inches.  There are placements for larger gear, but there are also small placements right next to those.  Two bolts at the top.  Walk off right to get to the main trail, left to get to the big ledge system.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Every thing from small cams and nuts to a number 2 camalot
output: finger-size, standard-rack, nuts

input: A few pieces .5 to 1 inch protect the lower section before reaching the first bolt. Four bolts will see you to the anchor with chains and rap rings 5 ft. left of Quarryman.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: gear to 4"
output: standard-rack, wide

input: TCUs, cams to 2.5 inches or so, set of nuts.  Fixed anchors at the top with rap rings, and you can TR and rap with a 60, but it will be close, so knot the ends of your rope!
output: finger-size, standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: This climb will take plenty of medium to large stoppers as well as doubles or triples of the finger and tight hand sized cams.  The largest piece you could place would be a #1 camalot at the overlap, but there are many alternatives.  There is one very old bolt near the top and then a good two bolt anchor with chains.   NOTE: with a 70m rope you can get down, but you have to be careful to take advantage of the base sloping up to the left and rope stretch.  With anything shorter, you'll need to use two ropes to get down.  Alternatively, the leader can top belay (on a very nice ledge) and the second can bring up the second rope.   If you're SUPER careful, you can rap with a single 60m rope if you land to the left, where the ground slopes upward.  Use knots!
output: finger-size, standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: Cams: doubles to 2", nuts.
output: standard-rack, nuts

input: Cams to 1.5 inches, med. nuts.  There are anchors with chains at the top.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: The route takes a variety of gear from Metolius 2 (yellow) up to Black Diamond 4 or equivalent. Double up on  mid-size (BD 0.5 to 1).
output: standard-rack, wide

input: Cams .5 to #2 Camelots and nuts. Save a #1 or #2 for the top. Can be rapped to a treed gully above and to the right of the start with a 60m rope.Copied from comments below so people donâ€™t miss it: â€œTIE KNOTS AT THE END OF THE ROPE IF YOU PLAN ON BEING LOWERED OR RAPPINGâ€
output: standard-rack, nuts

input: Gear to 3 inches, rap rings at top
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Gear to 2", emphasize wires and small cams. The gear is great to the top, but every placement looks like it will be your last.
output: finger-size, standard-rack

input: Standard rack to 3/4 in.
output: standard-rack, wide

input: Many pieces in the .5 and .75 camalot size. You would probably be ok with doubles if you are comfortable with short runouts. Singles of smaller cams and a #1, and #2 (BD Sizes) will round out the rack. There are nice new  fixed carabiners at the top of the route, don't run endless TR laps through them though.
output: standard-rack

input: Small finger-tip-sized Stoppers and a small cam or two for the crux. A few medium Stoppers to finish. Bolted anchor with chains can be found near the top of the cliff.
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, nuts, gear-anchor

input: gear to 4"
output: standard-rack, wide

input: Fingers to tight hand size cams.  I placed two pieces between the bolts up top, but they aren't totally neccessary.
output: finger-size, standard-rack

input: Gear to 3-4", primarily finger and hand size pieces.  I had two #3 camalots and was pleased to have them near the end of the pitch.
output: finger-size, standard-rack

input: Standard rack to 2".  The lower section of the climb eats nuts, saving finger-sized cams for the final section.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, nuts

input: Medium nuts and cams will get you through the initial corner and flare.  The upper crack takes hand sized gear, but note that it widens a bit inside, so choose your gear wisely: what enters the crack may tip out once it's inside.  Don't let  that comment worry you too much, the protection is excellent.
output: standard-rack, nuts

input: A rack of small cams to 2" and a set or two of stoppers and 10 draws or slings gets you to a bolt and chain anchor.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: This crack will take one or two every size of cam from .75" to 5" but it's not so long that doubles are warranted. You can gauge it from the bottom.  Bolted rap anchor.
output: standard-rack, wide, gear-anchor

input: Gear to 1.5 inches.  Belay off tree at the top.  Walk off the wall to the right, or back down to the ledge to the left.
output: standard-rack

input: Finger to hand sized cams and nuts.  Bolted anchor.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: TCUs, cams to 2.5", set of nuts.  Fixed anchor at the top, from which you can rap or TR with a 60.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

output: standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: Gear to 3"
output: standard-rack

input: small to 3"
output: finger-size, standard-rack

input: Aside from the traverse to the base of the crack, the protection is excellent throughout.  A standard rack up to a 3" cam will suffice.
output: standard-rack

input: Standard Squamish rack, small nuts to hand size cams.  Some long slings and/or double ropes.
output: finer-size, standard-rack, nuts

input: You can protect the crux with a orange Metollius cam, or a DMM walnut.
output: standard-rack, nuts

input: Gear to 3"
output: standard-rack

input: Cams to 2 inches. Two bolts with quicklinks at the top for lowering.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: singles to #2 Camalot,doubles of yellow and green aliens, stoppers.
output: standard-rack, finger-size, nuts

input: A double set of cams and nuts and a some long slings will get you to a bolt and chain anchor that can be lowered off of with a 70M rope.Â  A 60M is also reported to work, but I did not try it.
output: standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: Small gear to 2";  some easy runout to bolted anchor.  Rappel with one rope from chains.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Finger sized nuts or cams for the start.  A small selection of larger nuts and hand sized cams for the rest.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, nuts

input: Gear to hand sized.
output: standard-size

input: Standard Rack to 3 inches.  Belay off trees, or (with a directional) off the two bolts to the right (above Bilbo Baggins).
output: standard-size

input: Standard trad rack to 3".  Anchor is bolted and a 60m rope is long enough to TR.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: A standard rack, with a few doubles of cams in the finger to tight hand sizes and a good selection of small to medium nuts is sufficient.  There is a two bolt rap station at the top.  Double ropes will take you down, otherwise go to the chains on the ledge and make a second rap.  Watch then ends of the rope, even from this intermediate station.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: A standard rack will be entirely sufficient.  Bolts at the top.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Good selection of hand to finger sized gear. Chained rap anchor. 60m rope works nicely.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Gear to 1"
output: standard-size

input: Single rack to 2". Bolted anchor. Walk off.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: It gets wide, but you don't need wide gear because when it's wide it's kind of flary and unprotectable anyways. I have an inkling that if you were to take up a nut tool and scrape away at the non-vascular plant life you'd be able to place some bomber thin gear (blue/purple metolius?) in the back of the wide. Try it. Worst comes to worst you cleaned out the crack and performed a public service to all.   You're looking at a rack ranging from fingers to hands. There's bolts and rap rings at the top
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Gear to 1.5 inches.  Belay off trees or blocks at the top.  Walk left to get back to the ledge, or right to get to the bottom of the wall.
output: standard-rack

input: small gear (including small nuts and 0, 00 TCUs) and all the rest to 3"
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack, nuts

input: Gear to 1.5"

output: standard-rack

input: finger to hand size pieces
output: finger-size, standard-rack

input: Fingers to hands; bolted anchor at top
output: finger-size,standard-size, gear-anchor

input: A single set of hand and wide hands cams... more if continuing onto 'Asleep At the Wheel.'
output: standard-rack, wide

input: thin gear to #2 camalot
output: finger-size, standard-rack

input: Mostly large nuts and cams to 3 inches.  Bolted anchor at the top.
output: standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: Standard rack up to #2 Camalot.
output: standard-rack

input: Tight hands to hands.  You don't need much as the crux is short, and the rest is either solid jams, or very easy, or pinched off so it doesn't accept pro.  It's still a reasonably protected climb unless you're maxed out at 5.8.
output: standard-rack

input: Small rack to 2 inches.  Two bolts at the top, though I recommend a directional if you are going to top-rope the route (to keep the rope out of the crack).  You can walk off right (with a spotter at the bottom), or rappel off of trees.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Gear up to 1", maybe two .75s for the traverse. Small nut protects the crux well.
output: standard-rack, nuts

input: Camalots: 1-#2, 2-#3, 1 or 2 #4, 1 #4.5.  A #5 C4 would probably work instead of the 4.5.  A #6 will not fit throughout most, if not all, of the crux.
output: standard-rack, wide

input: RPs/HP offsets (bring a few of the medium to bigger sizes) to #2 camalot. Gear is excellent despite appearances.  Rap anchors on top.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: Two bolt anchor at top.Â  Gear to 3"
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Nothing bigger than Camalot #1. Heavy on small cams and stoppers. Draws for the start.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, nuts

input: Chain anchors, standard rack, mostly thin hands and smaller.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Gear to red camalot. Ends on two bolt anchor with mussy hooks.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Double set of cams to 1" and a set of nuts.
output: standard-rack, nuts

input: Mostly hand size cams and larger, but there are a few smaller cracks for nuts and smaller cams.  Bolted belay.
output: standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: Gear to 2"

input: gear to 3"
output: standard-rack

input: thin gear to 3"
output: finger-size, standard-rack

input: SR to #2, chains on top
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input:Gear to 2 inches (though there is one placement that could take a 3 inch piece if you've got it).
output: standard-rack

input: standard rack to #3, extra in small cams (optional #4).Shares anchor with Popsickle
output: finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Chain anchors. Two #3 Camalots and one #1 Camalot... you could bring more I suppose.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Gear to 3 inches.
output: standard-rack

input: standard nuts and cams to 1.5" or Easily toproped via backside approach. Single anchor bolt and a conveniently positioned tree at the top.
output: standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: plenty of cams for this long pitch, many small cams and offset brass nuts good for upper half.  Gonch pull takes medium to large nuts, so you can conserve cams for up higher.  The top out is a bit run-out after the tiny gear seam runs out.
output: finger-size, tiny-finger-size, nuts

input: Anything you want for the bottom section, small stuff (wires, cams as small as blue metolius...maybe you could place smaller if you wanted). Chains at the top.
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, gear-anchor

input: Gear is present but rarely a gimme on this climb. A single rack will do. Bolt anchors at the top.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: SR. 2-bolt anchors with rappel at the top. So you can rappel off or walk off.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Three bolts, maybe and nut or two and a #3 and/or #4 Camalot for the start.
output: standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: Chain anchors, doubles in finger sized gear.
output: gear-anchor, finger-size

input: SR, chains on top
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: mostly hand to fist size cams, and some smaller cams work.
output: standard-rack

input: Originally a gear climb with 2 bolts. Additional bolts were added by the FA party in the early 2000s - there are now a total of 3. Some additional gear can be useful, particularly a purple (#0) TCU or #3 Rock, and red Tricam.
output: tiny-finger-size, nuts

input: Standard rack. I used medium nuts and cams from a blue Alien to #3 Camalot. There is a bolted rappel anchor at the top.
output: standard-rack, nuts, finger-size, ,tiny-finger-size, gear-anchor

input: 1 set of nuts, Cams from 06-3.5 . Bolted anchor at top with rap rings.
output: finger-size, tiny-finger-size, standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: P1. All that is required is a yellow, grey, red alien and a .5 camalot. You could also drag up a #1 and/or a .75 and or a second yellow alien, but it's not runout to do the whole pitch on 3 - 4 pieces of gear.  P2 has bolts.
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack

input: Small gear from purple Metolius/green C3 to #1 Camalot. Doubles in tips/fingers pieces. Chains at the top.   Takes good small gear. I fiddled with small wires my first time up this, but climbed it again last weekend and didn't waste my time with any nuts, took solid cams at comforting intervals.
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Take at least doubles of .75camalot to #2 camalot. And at least a #3. You could take 2x #3 and 1x #4 camalot too. Also bring a set of nuts and some finger pieces (although you don't need to place finger gear if you dont want)
output: standard-rack, wide, nuts, finger-size

input: Some draws and nuts or small cams. A two-bolt anchor and chains are up top.
output: finger-size, nuts, gear-anchor

input: Nuts and cams to 2 inches. Rap rings at top.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: 1 set of nuts and cams from 0.6-3.5"
output: standard-rack, nuts

input: Thin gear protects the crux moves. Hand-sized and a bolt after the corner.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Standard Rack with an emphasis on large hand size pieces. Easy to protect throughout, except when the crack becomes clogged with roots and grime. Crux protects beautifully. Two-bolt anchor at the top right, easy to miss.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Doubles of green alien (blue tcu) to .75 camalot. Single #1 and #2 camalot. You could get by with just one green alien too. Like lots of Squamish, you could use 3 or 4 in the off fingers size. I usually roll with doubles of both grey and red alien. Bolt at the top. Two bolt anchor.
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: It is 40- 45 Meter pitch so having many finger size is recommended. Double rack to 3", maybe 3 each in the 1/4"-  1/2" size or lots of nuts work too. Bolted belay on ledge at base and tree belay at top. There is a 2 bolt anchor about 10' north but I came up the OW finish which seems to make sense with a tree right there.I was not prepared for the OW, placed a #2 at start of it and layback up to top, could use a #4, but not really needed.I was informed by a local that the OW finish used to be full of vegetation and I guess that is why there is the bolted anchor off left at the top.
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor, wide

input: Singles from fingers to 3", with some extra padding in the #0.75 camalot range. Bolts and rings at the top
output: finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: A single set of cams, with small gear most helpful. 6-8 Quickdraws.
output: finger-size, standard-rack

input: Standard set of cams to #1 with 2-3 green #0.75s. Steel clip-and-lower carabiners at the anchor.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: A set of cams from .4" to 2" including extra .6" to .1" (I found green to red Aliens to be a nice fit), small to medium nuts/offsets, some runners, attentive belayer
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack, nuts

input: Mostly thin up to a 0.5 camalot.  Stoppers.  You can place a #1, but it will get in the way of the only real hand jam!  Fixed anchors.
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: Thin gear- nothing bigger than a purple camalot.
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size

input: BD-sized cams .5-3 should do it. Protects great, just don't get your cams sucked into the crack!
output: finger-size, standard-rack

input: Single set small, medium nuts; single set .5" (green alien) to 4" cams (C4 #5 camalot).  Optional extra .33" cam (black alien), 1" cam (#.75 camalot), 4" cam (C4 #5 camalot).
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack, wide, nuts

input: fingers at the bottom and 0.75-1 camalot at the top.  A #2 can be placed halfway, but there are other options.  Most will want at least two each 0.75-1.
output: finger-size, standard-rack

input: Cams from tips to thin hands, a single set should be fine, with maybe two .75s.Â chains at the top.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Either a short batman up a fixed line to 4 bolts (dirty 5.10) to an anchor at the base, or do a messy scramble from the left to the base, then:  Two 1.5" cams, (or 2 purple camalots)  Three 2.0" cams (or 3 green camalots)  Three 2.5" cams (or 3 red camalots)  two 3" cams (or two yellow camalots)  and finally a 1" or a .75" cam or two for the top. (or a blue or grey micro camalot)   To reach a set of chains.  That should put in pretty tightly spaced pro.  YMMV.
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Single rack from fingers to hands with an extra 1" piece should do it. Bolts with rings at the top
output: finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: 4 bolts, a small cam or two for the undercling (red or green c3), a few cams in the range from #0.5-#2 c4 for the finish. Sport Anchors.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Gear to 2 inches...
output: finger-size, standard-rack

input: The gear I used in order was:   gold BD nut  silver BD nut (big one)  0.5 camalot  #1 camalot  #1 camalot  red DMM offset nut  blue DMM offset nut  red BD nut  blue BD nut (big one)  yellow metolius  #2 camalot  0.75 camalot
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack, nuts

input: Cams and Nuts....single set from #3 Camalot to .5 (possible to place #4 as well) and a selection of small cams. Small-Med Stoppers. 6 slings/draws. Fixed 'biners on the chains. Those not on-sighting are encouraged to scope the gear, which is not always obvious (in the overhang anyway).
output: finger-size, standard-rack, wide, nuts, gear-anchor

input: SR from tips to thin hands. Bolts and rings at the top.
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Standard rack with bolts at the top.  You might want to set a directional to reduce rope drag over a sharp corner if you're planning on setting up a toprope.
output: standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: Standard single rack plus Small gear blue, green alien to protect the slab at the top. Piton. Anchors at the top.
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input:Lots of big cams. Bolted anchors
output: wide, very-wide

input: Gear to 2" but some people may want doubles around finger sizes...
output: finger-size, standard-rack

input: Bolts and 1-2 each size Aliens or TCU's etc in the .6" & .75" range protect tricky moves.
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack

input: Protection is found in the crack of Crime of the Century and then, after the traverse, in the thin splitter. Good small tcu's and nuts. Use a few long slings to reduce rope drag. Chain anchors suitable for lowering at top.
output: tiny-finger-size, nuts, gear-anchor

input: It was originally climbed with fixed pins, then retro bolted after the removal of the pins.  The climb has been done (twice) by my knowledge on gear (I watched my partner send skipping the bolts and placing 25 pieces.)  However, if you don't have the time to figure out the gear and are less inclined for that challenge, there are 8 bolts.  The climb still requires a set of micro nuts, 1 purple tcu, 2 blue tcu's, 2 yellow tcu's, 2 purple camalots, and one each from green camalot to gold.  An all gear ascent will require the full gamet including brass nuts, 000 c3s etc.
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack, nuts, gear-anchor

input: Doubles from fingers - #2 camalot should be fine.  I placed one #3 before the finger crack.  Stoppers.  A 60 m rope JUST gets you down.  Tie knots!!
output: finger-size, standard-rack, nuts

input: one set of nuts and a double set of cams to 2" will be enough. The line is pretty straight and doesn't require many runners. There are two newly placed rap rings at the top.
output: nuts, finger-size, standard-rack, gear-anchor

input: You don't need a lot of pieces but you do need the right ones.  I remember red Camalot, small nut, fixed pin, #5 Rock, 3 Camalot, 4 Friend. FP, green Alien and #2 Camalot. to get through the difficulties.  I placed a piece or two higher up but don't remember what they were.  Use runners judiciously as the climb weaves around roofs.
output: tiny-finger-size, finger-size, standard-rack, wide, nuts

input: Gear up to 2" for starting the corner. Above there are 2 bolts and available placements for a small cam down to a medium offset brass nut. The book says SR but I took some doubles which I was happy to have.
output: finger-size, standard-rack, tiny-finger-size, nuts, gear-anchor

input: Gear to a #4 camalot ought to do.
output: standard-rack, wide
