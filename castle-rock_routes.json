A memorable line, Canary combines interesting climbing with terrific exposure.Approximately 100 feet to the left of Saber, a short section of face climbing leads to a right facing dihedral and a broken crack system that reaches the left side of Saber ledge. This is the start of Canary.P1. Begin by climbing approximately 15 feet of unprotected face to the base of a right facing dihedral. This section is not trivial, but the holds are positive and it is no harder than 5.7. Alternatively, it may be possible to begin in a small dihedral to the left and traverse right to gain the crack system at the top of the face. From the top of the face, follow the dihedral and subsequent crack systems up with good gear. Ascend until you are under the giant roof, then break right onto Saber ledge at the top of the crack system. This pitch is the technical crux of the climb, culminating in the moves up and onto Saber Ledge (5.8). Belay from gear or the giant eyebolts on the right of Saber Ledge.P2. From Saber ledge, contemplate what lies ahead. The second pitch begins with instant exposure, and the airy step off Saber ledge may be the pyschological crux of the climb. Begin by traversing obvious holds leading left and slightly up from Saber ledge. Though intimidating, the traverse is easier than it looks, and giant holds await you on the arete. It is possible to protect the traverse with a reasonable small alien on the face, otherwise it may be possible to place large gear (with long slings!) above Saber ledge before beginning. Upon reaching the arete, climb past two bolts and follow your nose and your gear.P3. From the alcove on the face, continue upwards on increasingly slabby terrain, following the intermittent cracks for protection. Like many routes on upper Castle, the exact line is not obvious; expect some runouts on easier terrain.. Belay at the top.To descend, follow the trail off the back of the summit to Logger's Ledge.",

Recently it came to my attention that there was some controversy surrounding Dan's Dreadful Direct, and I thought it appropriate I should add my voice to the equation, since I had the moment of privelege granted to me by Jim Yoder and had the belay and support of John Stoddard to free climb this wonderful route for the first time. Indeed, John's point of view, that the existing manky old fixed pin on Damnation Crack did contribute to some level of safety for the crux section of the route, is an accurate statement. It was an ackward clip, but it was also a critical piece of protection. Personally, I have no problem with the addition of a good bolt in a location that would be in about the same area as the original pin. One bolt is more than adequate. Additional bolts to make a sport climb of this route is not acceptable. When Jim, John, and I did the climb we did it with the idea of using the natural protection available on the climb. The use of RP's was critical to success, and I understand that new protection has replaced RP's as the gear of choice for ultra small placements. For many of my climbs I logged \"air time\" figuring out moves, with many a fall onto RP's down to #1 size. When used properly they provide psychological and sometimes real protection. Climbs that are conceived as bold statements of ability for control with long runouts over difficult rock should stand in as original condition as possible. In the event the original climb is altered with the loss of a fixed pin or bolt, then the climb should be restored to as near to original condition as possible. In my opinion this climb, while having an element of danger, was not a lethal proposition, but certainly had the potential for painful consequences for failure. Not all climbs are for all people. In fact the ability to do a given climb is a temporary condition and a privelege that should be enjoyed fully at the moment.

Climbers seem to get lost on the 2nd pitch, it could be done in at least 3 different ways, all about the same grade and gear. The original line after crossing the void follows some old pins that can be hard to spot till on a big ledge, about 100', here is the improbable looking right trending traverse with a ring pin. It looks harder then 5.5, might be 5.7, but turns out to be easier then it looks. keep lower on the traverse to find pro till in wide gully like corner, follow this out veering right on ramp like crack to boulders at top.

We ran into a guide climbing next to us who said this is the route he takes his clients up if they request a good 5.8 multipitch. I can confirm this, as I\u2019m a new climber usually doing 5.7s and this route brutalized me. I could not have completed it without hang-dogging most moves. The \u201cchimney\u201d is small and you don\u2019t actually climb inside it, just alongside it. You can use it as a crack. If you have trouble getting up the \u201cchimney\u201d, the next two pitches are even harder. The top of the chimney is your last chance to rap down without leaving gear. Bring radios because you can\u2019t hear each other on Pitch 2 and 3. Pitch 1 has a bolted anchor. Pitch 2 and 3 need trad anchors. You can walk off the top down to the base of the route in 15 mins. The approach from the car is about another 15 mins. The end of Pitch 3 is kind of runout for maybe 20 feet until you top off. The hardest part of this climb is mentally doing the first move of Pitch 2. You have to stand up on the tiny top of Jello Tower and then stretch your hands and foot across a large gap of open air. If you don\u2019t make it, you fall down into the rocky chimney. Pitch 2 and 3 have many ledges that are a great quick break, but you could potentially hit if you fall when leading. Jun 2, 2018",

I did that first pitch when I first started trad and I was intimidated... Throw some strong howling winds through that OW in the corner and yea. I'd say be confident on 5.7/8. Then again, maybe it was just the wind. May 18, 2016",

Instead of the squeeze tunnel of normal Midway, Direct goes up and then slightly left after the Jello Tower step across. Follow the shallow dihedral up about 45 feet until it ends and is capped by an 8 inch roof. At this point there is a 20 foot exposed, runnout traverse across to the right to regular Midway...but don't do that! Instead, place a bomber hand sized piece and move up and left on the vertical face. It looks completely unprotectable and blank, but there are super secure incut edges along with slots for bomber small wired nuts. The rock is clean and you are never more than 8 feet from great pro. Climb up and left  following the clean rock and good gear until you get to the ledge where a small tree is growing. From the tree-bush, go up and then left following the crack systems to a great belay alcove. One more shortish pitch will put you on top.

Originally a 2-pitch A3 aid climb put up by Fred Beckey, Eric Bjornstad, and Jim Stuart, it was freed during the great Ltown renaissace of the mid-80's by Gred Child, Matt Kerns, and Jim Yoder. Former PNW crusher Kyle O'Meara envisioned a direct start up beautiful white rock which would allow the route to be climbed in one pitch. Unfortunatly, Kyle ran out of bolts, and was only able to sink in the first three. Nonetheless it didnt keep Kyle from freeing the line with a stick clip to start and traditional pro (a few cams and a sea of manky fixed pins) through the upper crux bulge. This half-finished pseudo-\"traditional\" version saw possibly just one additional free ascent over the next few years. In the spring of 2014, Dave Morales, added the missing couple of bolts to the direct start, replaced the manky fixed pins through the upper crux with bolts, and added a lower 2-bolt anchor.    The route begins with beautiful climbing using perfect edges and side-pulls on aesthetic white stone. From a midway rest ledge a perplexing bouldery crux leads to a more moderate finish up a shallow corner system.",

Look for a left angling ramp just to the right of a large, low roof.  This is the start of Saber.   P1.  Climb the left angling ramp to the base of a left facing dihedral.  The rock in the dihedral has been polished to a slippery, disconcerting, mirror-like sheen.  When you hit a diaganol crack heading up to the left follow it to Saber ledge.  Belay from bolts. (~90 feet)   P2.  A few easy moves (~5.5) on the left side of a wide chimney take you up onto emminently forgettable and blocky terrain.  The climbing gets easier as you ascend, and I found myself on 4th or 3rd class terrain long before reaching the top of Castle rock (~190 feet).   I've stuck with the historical rating for this climb, which may be a bit of a sandbag-- a more realistic rating for the first pitch may be 5.6.  Combined with the polished rock, this route is probably not the best choice for a fledgling trad leader.  One star for history and for being an accesible moderate as well as a good place to booty gear, but I can't imagine wanting to do this twice.",

Definitely stiff for the grade the way I did it, but it was a blast with some very committing moves. The start was an awesome boulder problem, maybe V1 or V2. You'll notice that in the picture that after the boulder problem I started going right and then back left into the crack system. I'm not sure if that's the exact location in the picture but as you're making your way up after the boulder problem, you'll get to a point where it starts becoming an overhang, sorta. I didn't feel comfortable going up that overhang (also unable to place pro at this point) and saw some good holds to the right. At the time, I felt like that was the best approach to the problem. After talking to a friend who did the climb a year ago, he mentioned an easier way: starting right and traversing left to the zig zag crack line and then working your way up the horizontal cracks (pictured below). I haven't tried this way. My partners and I turned the second pitch into 2 pitches. The 2nd part of the second pitch is definitely a scramble, but you'll want to place some gear nonetheless.

We stopped at the bolted anchors 30 feet? before the tree. (mostly because that it was what the party before us did). The corner/groove leading up to the second crux was a little sketch...mostly due to moss, but the protection was not super awesome. Moss made it look like it doesn't see much traffic. Rock in that area sided on the edge of hollow in my opinion...and since when are rusted pitons placed likely 30+ years ago called \"good?\" We belayed at the ledge below the second crux. (The party ahead of us bailed here bc they got sketched out at the crux). At the second crux, I climbed the crack just before the arete to do this part...thought i could get more gear? ...which was fine, but again...that old bolt/hanger has seen much better days, and blowing it before getting a second piece would of super sucked no matter how you did it. Rest of pitch 3 was fun, but definitely warm in the sun! Best for a bit of a cooler day. First 2 pitches stayed in the shade pretty late, so that was awesome. (one of the bigger reasons we did it). Where we stopped for our belays did not really affect the climb for better or worse (that I could tell). Long story short...climb was fun/worth doing, but did not always have super bomber gear (in my opinion), so be prepared for a little spice. <3 Jul 7, 2014",

Searched around through the moss for a while but decided not to continue as the only reasonable option looked unprotectable (turns out it was the right way after all). A 70m rope barely made it back to the ground from there. UPDATE: Just went back and successfully finished the route. The gear is definitely a little sparse and iffy, but always where I wanted it. The bolt felt poorly placed in my opinion, a little higher and maybe it would protect you from breaking your ankle on the ledge, if you were to blow the face moves. Regarding the moss and lichen, I noticed that on the second pitch every worth while foot and hand hold was relatively clean, while on the easier terrain I couldn't always tell if I was crimping on lichen or an edge. There were also a few cracks that almost looked like they would take gear with a little cleaning.
