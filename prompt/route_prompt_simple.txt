You are responsible for returning a JSON object containing a set of tags based only on the allowed tags listed below. Do not invent any new tags. Your output must strictly follow the JSON format shown in the example.

Input Data (for each route) will include:
- Route Description
- Route Location
- Route Type
- Route Protection (with details relevant for crack climbing)
- Combined Route Comments and Tick Comments

Your task is to analyze the provided input text and return a JSON object in the following format:
