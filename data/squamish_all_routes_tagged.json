        "description": "The Art exhibit is a forested east facing crag on the south side of Debecks hill, just behind the sky ridge development. The cliff gets filtered morning sun and stays cool all day on hot summer days. The cliff is vertical to gently overhanging and is mostly smooth granite with sharp positive edges. Routes are roughly 18-20m tall. A single 60m rope will work for all routes. With any new wall, there will always be a bit of exfoliation and wearing a helmet is always recommended!\u00a0Casey and I developed only a small portion of the entire cliff band. There is still a significant amount of rock left, undeveloped. An additional 20-30 routes could easily be added if other developers decide to add some lines.",
        "getting_there": "Park at the North end of Tantalus drive. Approx 10-15mins uphill. Hike up through the looking glass trail until a T intersection. Go right up Plural of Nemesis until another T intersection. Go left and over a little wooden bridge. You will see the cliff on the right side of the trail just about the bridge. Follow the light climbers trail along the base of the cliff until you reach the Art Exhibit. The red x on the map is the location of the crag.",

        "description": "Debeck's Hill is a \u00a0sport climbing crag sitting conveniently a 15-20 min walk up a a forest service road in Alice Lake Park. While a couple of routes had been done in the late 1990's, it was cleaned and further developed in 2019 with additional development ongoing. There are currently about 20 climbs with more in work. There is a first tier of climbs about 20m tall and a second tier of slightly longer climbs which can be accessed by climbing the lower climbs or using a fixed line up a mossy ramp. The lower tier is in the trees and stays mostly shaded but the upper tier gets morning and midday sun. The crag sits directly next to the trail / road giving it a chill cragging vibe. The climbing is much more fun and interesting than it first appears with many great routes.I have only climbed some of the climbs on the first tier but there is also a second tier with a few routes and more in development. All the climbs seemed to have fixed anchors / chains and some had biners set up for easy cleaning. Feel free to add more routes to MP as you climb them!As of July 2023, crag is a bit mossy in spots (adds to the less than inspiring appearance), but most of the climbs are sufficiently cleaned to climb. Could use some additional scrubbing though!News article about crag:  seatoskyclimbing.ca/latest-\u2026 link to topo on \"Sea to Sky Climbing\":  static1.squarespace.com/sta\u2026",
        "getting_there": "Park in the southern most lot at Alice Lake Provincial park. Walk south to the turn around loop and at the end of the pavement turn right onto a dirt road blocked by a yellow gate (sign for Debeck's hill). Keep right at the first junction and walk 15-20 minutes uphill. The crag will be on your left directly off the side of the dirt road.(Walking another 15 minutes up the road gets you to the top of Debeck's hill and a great lunch spot with a view!)",

It has one of the fastest and flattest approaches, a comparable walking distance from smoke bluffs parking to free and easy crag (approx 10 mins). The cliff has filtered sun and stays cool on hot days. There is also a year round creek nearby for water. A 60m rope will work for all routes. Most routes are mixed. Most routes have only seen 1 or 2 ascents and with any new wall there will always be some rock exfoliation, so wearing a helmet is always recommended.PDF topo link belowhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1-A6Fp3dqAkOjO2fldePilMgjXClKtFhR/view?usp=drivesdk",

One of the best 5.7s in Squamish, not often you get to climb so many unique styles in a single route.Start on steep jugs, clipping a bolt and plugging extra gear if you wish. Next, move onto the low-angle face for a few delicate thin and balancy moves as you climb left through glacier polish into a friendly (but steep) layback flake. Layback or jam up the flake, then foot-traverse along the top of it left for 10 feet (unprotectable but easy, place a #2 or #3 Camalot at the top of the flake before the traverse) until you get to a beautiful hand-crack. Get to jamming, the crack goes from #3 to #1 Camalots if I remember correctly. At the giant perched boulder, traverse left underneath it, then walk up a bit to a steep, blocky chimney finish.**Be careful when lowering. This is a rope-stretcher even with a 70m, tie knots in your rope**\u00a0Another option is to bring up your second and walk off together, potentially safer.",

A bolt-protected bouldery start leads to a sporty section before reaching the main crack (bring some small wires or maybe a microcam to keep you safe before you reach it - I used a #3 and a #4 RP doubled up - you might be able to get a shallow finger-sized piece a little further left in a horizontal but it didn't look inspiring to me.) From there the crack slowly widens through interesting climbing from fingers to hands, to wide hands until you ultimately reach the 6\" crack that takes you to the top. Lots of friendly wavy jugs and edges for the feet to augment the crack climbing.\u00a0The climb was a little dusty/dirty when I got on it, maybe because there isn't a huge overlap between 5.8 climbers and climbers who own wide gear, but it's definitely clean enough to be very fun.\u00a0The route reminded me a little of Garfield in spirit, in that it's much more adventurous climbing than you tend to get in Squamish at the grade. Not quite as classic though.\u00a0There are apparently two variations where you break right at different points to avoid the wide crack, both go at 5.10 and I can't comment to their quality.",

The climbing here is much steeper than your average Smoke Bluffs 5.9, with locker fingers in a fine-grained crack that feels much more like climbing a basalt crack sometimes. 10 meters of fairly strenuous climbing for the grade gets you two a few body-weight jugs that aren't obvious until you pull on them.

The route can be accessed from below by climbing Berrycup or Crescent Crack but the 'legal' approach involves an easy rap in, which is good if you want to TR or pre-hang some draws.Begin from an anchor on a slab above Berrycup. Face climb easily and clip a couple bolts to where the wall steepens. Dance up tricky 5.11 to gain the left angling crack, which is well protected and succumbs to balancy laybacking. When the crack peters out, compose yourself and launch into an improbable looking hand traverse on decent edges, but almost nothing to speak of for feet. Crimp along clipping 3 bolts until you reach a dyke crack, and some respite. Finish up a beautiful short tips to fingers splitter which forms the left boundary of a humongous detached flake (it's not going anywhere).

The first pitch could probably be skipped (which you can do since you rap in), but it's necessary for the full experience.  The stump that in 1980 was probably quite solid, is now quite questionable.  Unfortunately, until it comes off completely, you pretty much have to use it to get started.  The rest of the climbing isn't hard, but it's dirty from lack of use and some of the blocks and flakes move.   P2 (5.11b) This spectacular pitch heads up the arch passing a number of overlaps.  To be sure you head right under the correct overlap, note the following: you'll get a very weird long skinny flexing flake for your hands and see a bolt on the face above the next overlap.  Clip the bolt, but don't pull up over the overlap, instead, head right and clip another bolt and you'll curve around to the belay.  We got confused and pulled up that overlap (aid) and suffered through dirt and scary loose flakes.  A first we thought going right at the bolts was another route, Underly Hanging Out, but that one is one overlap lower.   P3 (5.10a) From the belay pull up and left into the obvious cracks.  Getting over the lip is harder than it looks involving a tight hand jam, a fist jam and something akin to humping.  The guidebook describes a final sting in the tail, but it's very mild, especially if you have small cams (I used a blue alien, but there are other options).",

Hike south along the top of the Malamute and follow the trail down until there's an obvious anchor beyond which the cliff pretty much ends.  Rap from this anchor (50m) to a treed ledge called Meare's Island.  The best option is to bring two ropes and do a single rope rap, carrying your lead rope down with you.  This works well since you won't need to pull your rope and then haul the extra line back up the climb.  You could get by with a single rope, but since the anchors have no chains, you would have to leave 'biners on at least one of the stations on the way down (and recover them on the way back up).   At the bottom of the rap, look left and you'll see a chain hanging from a bolt.  Batman up the chain and start the first pitch from there.  Alternatively, you could stop at the anchor at the start of the second pitch and skip the first one.",

Clip a bolt from the ground, then move through a lower 5th staircase for 20 feet or so, plugging a piece every now and then. Extend the pieces.    The main feature itself took pretty much exclusively bomber #3 Camalots. I had two, and shuffled them up as I went. While it's surely a grunt, the nature of the flare is quite secure.   After my sport climbing partner topped out after grunting and french freeing through the flare, his eyes bugged out of his head when I told him it was graded 10a in the guidebook.

The climbs are primarily 5.11 and 5.12, although there are two at 5.10b and one 5.9.   The wall is taller and steeper than many sport areas around squamish and has good, though-provoking climbing.  It faces east and has sun until about noon depending on the season.  The base can be buggy, bring bug juice.   Here's a link to a topo that also includes directions.   Peter Winter has requested that TRs be done from draws rather than through the chains; good advice in any area.",
        "getting_there": "While this crag is in the same vicinity as The Sanctuary, the approach is different.   Take the Mamquam Forest Service Road (the one you take for  The Apron parking lot), drive past Slhanay and stay left at the forks until you can park in a clearing just left of a gate (Epcor).   Walk along the trail at the end of the clearing, past concrete barriers, until you can head left onto the Farther Side mountain bike trail.  Follow the trail, staying left, until it has turned to head east and is fairly level.  In a few minutes the crag should then be just barely visible from the trail, and flagging tape helps locate the very rough trail to the base.  You'll probably bushwack the first time.  Total time from parking should be 10 to 15 minutes.",

Many thanks to Tess Egan, Jason Robinson and Kye Egan-Robinson for developing this area. They built it out with families in mind and the bottom of has been well cleared. Please do not cut down any more trees. They provide excellent shade in the heat of summer. Avoid hiking around to the top of the crag to set up top-ropes since the easy routes on the far let provide safe, quick access to the top. Finally, we ask that guides not use this crag for large groups since it would make it impossible for anyone else to climb.",

The knowledge of the cliff gained from this FA allowed us to piece together the line that would later become Goldilocks Zone. With a dangerous crux followed by a long and involved traverse there is little to recommend this route. I will enter for the record and to offer future explorers some insight to what has been done on this portion of the wall. \u00a0The first 4 pitches are pretty much the same as GL Zone. Following the line of weakness lead us up to left side of the arching overhangs that cap the lower wall. The crux involved high quality but dangerous climbing (feel free to add a bolt here) up a shallow corner followed by a long, tedious traverse under the massive arch feature.

        "description": "Top Shelf is a relatively new crag in the Squamish area that is stacked with high quality crack lines. The rock is bomber, the routes are clean, and the lines are aesthetic. My hat goes off to the folks who developed this area, as I'm sure it was no easy task to get this wall to the beautiful condition that it's in. The wall faces northwest and gets shade for most of the day. The base of the wall is very well maintained with logs and flat belay areas. Nearly all of the routes can be climbed with a 60 m rope (always tie knots!), most anchors have fixed draws on them for lowering (don't remove them!), and most folks will want a double set of cams from fingers to wide hands and a #4. It would not be out of the question to bring triples up to a #1 camalot, as many of the routes are so splitter! The only thing lacking at this wall are moderates. Most of the climbs are 5.10 and up, and the grades felt a bit harder than similarly graded climbs in the area. The wall is steeper than it appears, so the climbs tend to be pretty pumpy.There are quite a few projects on the wall. Please respect those as the route developer has put a lot of hard work in to the line.Additional info can be found at  squamishclimbingsource.word\u2026",
        "getting_there": "The closest parking pull out to the trailhead is about 1.7 miles (2.7 km) along the Mamquam Forest Service road. Before you get to the pullout, you'll pass a black and yellow \"2 up\" road sign on the right. \u00a0Directly across from the sign, on the left side of the road, is a small pullout. \u00a0Consider this \"pullout 1\" \u00a0A little futher, there is a large pullout on the left with a no camping sign, \"pullout 2.\" \u00a0And little further is another pullout on the left, \"pullout 3.\" \u00a0The trail, which starts on the right side of the road, is between pullout 3 and pullout 4 (pullout 4 is a little further along the road). \u00a0As of June 2019, the trail was marked with orange flagging tape. \u00a0Using Gaia, the waypoint at the trailhead was 49.70334, -123.11871.Follow the trail into the forest. The trail is pretty well worn and easy to follow, but steep. \u00a0After roughly 15 minutes, you'll come to a cairned junction. \u00a0To the right is the New Dehli and Lantern Wall. \u00a0Stay left for Top Shelf. \u00a0After another 15 minutes or so, you'll come to another junction. \u00a0This junction is about 100 feet away from the base of a dirty, mossy cliff. \u00a0Go right at this junction, and after a couple minutes you'll you arrive at the well worn base area. \u00a0Eye Catcher is the obvious left-facing dihedral just to the left of where the trail meets the cliff.A fixed rope left of Eye Catcher leads to the left side of the wall. \u00a0Looking at the photos in McLane and Boyd's 2018 guidebook, it would be easy to mistake the second trail junction as the split between the left and right side of the walls, but this is not the case.Using Gaia, the waypoint at the base of Eye Catcher was 49.70085, -123.11427.",

Place some high pieces and punch it through 20 feet of technical and insecure climbing. Fancy footwork is key to success here as the locks are not that great.

        "description": "Mt. Habrich is a granite horn east of Squamish. Despite a fairly lengthy approach, some routes on Mt. Habrich are quite popular with with multiple parties not uncommon on summer weekends. The rock is well featured and generally very good quality, and the views are spectacular both on route and from the summit.",
        "getting_there": "Access has improved in 2014 with the opening of the Sea to Sky gondola.ApproachBegin by reaching the upper gondola station, via one of the following:1. Ride the gondola. Check their website for prices and times.2. Hike the Sea-to-Summit trail from the gondola base. This adds 900m of elevation gain to an otherwise long day.3. Drive to near the upper gondola station via a network of forest service roads. Begin by turning east from Highway 99 onto the Mamquam River road (this is the road by the Apron parking lot). After about 4 kilometres turn right onto the Stawamus-Indian FSR, and then right again onto the Shannon Creek FSR after an additional 1.5 kilometres. A gate blocks the road about 9 kilometres from Highway 99, and about 2 kilometres from the upper gondola station. Park here, and walk/mountain bike the rest of the way. Note that a 4WD high clearance vehicle is required, though barring this mountain bikes would certainly save some time.From the upper gondola station take the signed Sky Pilot Valley trail. This trail follows a graded road for about two kilometres, then leaves the road via a left turn onto an old spur road. This junction is obvious and is marked.\u00a0A small clearing on the spur road is reached after about 50-60 minutes of hiking in total from the upper gondola station. Often there is a cairn and/or a fire pit here, and this was a common bivy location in years past before the opening of the gondola. Mt. Habrich is visible high above the clearing on the left.\u00a0To this point, the approach has consisted of very easy hiking but that is all about to change. An obvious trail branches left from the clearing and climbs very steeply through the forest, gaining about 500 metres in elevation (to a col just below the west face of Mt. Habrich.From the upper gondola station, the time of the approach to the west col is about two hours.Two routes begin from this col. Mt. Habrich's regular route meanders up a series of ledge systems and is mainly 4th class with a few low fifth class moves. Just left of this is the relatively new route Escape Velocity which has become quite popular.Just below the col, a fairly obvious trail branches climber's right (east) and passes by a clean looking wall with several routes. The trail leads around an ar\u00eate/buttress to reach the start of the popular route Life On Earth in about 5 minutes. The trail continues, passing the south face route (4th class), and it is possible to traverse the ridge all the way to Sky Pilot with some scrambling and fixed lines.Note that the west col of Mt. Habrich can also be reached by following the signed Al's Habrich Ridge trail. The latter part of the trail is more of a route and consists of scrambling up and down over many sub-summits along the ridge leading towards Mt. Habrich. As an adventurous hike, this is very enjoyable and makes for a nice loop when combined with the regular approach. Keep in mind that this route is much longer than the regular approach. It took us almost 5 hours to reach the west col of Mt. Habrich from the upper gondola station going this way.DescentThere are several possibilities.It is possible to down climb the regular route, which is equipped with some fixed lines and is fairly easy to follow. Keep in mind this gets steep near the bottom and has some 4th or low 5th class downclimbing there. Otherwise the route Escape Velocity can be rappelled with a single rope and is equipped with chain anchors. The quickest non-sketchy way to descend to the west col is likely a combination of these two - down climbing the regular route to the top of the second or third pitch of Escape Velocity, and then rappelling that route the rest of the way to the col.It is also possible to rappel Life On Earth with two ropes.",

The route is very clean with well featured rock, and has great exposure and amazing views along its entire length. The route has some crack climbing but mainly consists of lower angle face climbing on small holds. Cruxes are often protected by bolts, and though there are definitely some runouts in general the route is well protected.  All belays are fixed with bolts. Pitch lengths and grades described below are estimates. Feel free to send me a message if corrections are needed.  See the Mt. Habrich page for details on the approach.  P1: 40m, 5.10b. From around the right side of the ar\u00eate, climb to the top of a pedestal. Clip a bolt, then move right into the left-facing corner. Climb the corner, wide at first, for several metres until a line of bolts lead left and up to the belay.Beta:\u00a0 I placed a BD#4 in the corner to protect a short section of laybacking, but this was the only place I used it on the entire route.\u00a0  A direct start to pitch 1 begins left of the regular route and climbs directly up the ar\u00eate at 5.11c.P2: 45m, 5.10c. Climb up the left facing corner on somewhat grainy rock through a bulge (10a) for a few metres until reaching bolts on the left face that lead left and up to the belay. The crux is near the end of the pitch.  P3: 50m, 5.10c. A mix of easier cracks and bolted face climbing lead to a belay on the crest of the ar\u00eate. The crux is near the end, and consists of stepping left from a groove/corner and climbing a face protected by a bolt.\u00a0Beta:\u00a0 When I first climbed this route I used half ropes with double rope technique. With this I was able to clip a high piton in the groove on the right as well as the bolt on the left face while still avoiding rope drag. With a single rope you have to use long slings and still manage rope drag, or skip a placement and run it out.\u00a0  P4: 55m, 5.10c. Climb straight up the face. The first bolt is very high - look for nut placements. Step left of the ar\u00eate into a groove, then back right to face climbing that leads to a belay on the right side of the ar\u00eate.P5: 45m, 5.10b. Climb left and up to a short crack, then up and right on a lower angled bolt protected face.The summit of Mt. Habrich is a short scramble from here.  DescentRappel the route with two ropes, right back to the packs you left at the base (recommended).Alternatively, from the summit make six rappels, up to 30 metres in length, down the route Escape Velocity to reach the col on the west side of Mt. Habrich. The first rappel anchor is just below the summit. All anchors are fixed.Alternatively, from the summit downclimb the regular route, skiers left of Escape Velocity. As of July 2014 this was equipped with some fixed lines, though a rappel or two may be necessary as you get near the west col. At this point the regular route is very close to both the second and third pitches of Escape Velocity, and it would be easy to use the rappel anchors on that route if necessary.See the link below for a topo of Escape Velocity that also shows the regular route. Note that this topo describes the regular route as a \"bush thrash\", but it seemed quite reasonable to me.  jeremyfrimer.com/uploads/2/\u2026",
                "location": "I brought a rack from green Alien to BD#4 along with a set of nuts. I placed the 4 just once, and the 3 maybe twice. There are a lot of bolts, and so just a single rack of cams is sufficient. There are many places where nuts fit great and cams do not.Bring at least 10-12 draws, including some \"alpine type\" draws.Double ropes are needed to retreat or to rappel the route.",

The climbing is an eclectic mix, with plenty of easy and moderate climbs and some hard trad test pieces.At the south end of the wall are some moderate sport climbs (5.7-10d). The middle of the wall has the hardest climbing, including some very bold climbs: The Gunslinger (13d trad) and The Bull (14a R trad). The north end includes The Reacharound, a fantastic moderate that is included in Marc Bourdon's Top 100 Squamish Climbs.Directly across from The Reacharound is the Common Wealth, which contains a number of mainly easier traditionaly protected climbs and is quite popular.Two recently developed (2013) nearby crags are Quercus Cliff, which is a few minutes walk along the Murrin Loop trail, and The Valley of the Lost Tribe which is around the right side of the Common Wealth.Details on these new crags are available at  quickdrawpublications.com/ . See the Free Downloads page.http://vimeo.com/42090546http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&v=B5mlA3YuMtY",

Like the book says, the hardest moves are low but if you don't finesse all the way, it'll shut you down! Boulder out the start and lean out to place gear. A few of the placements, especially at the start are hard to spot and a little finicky and some brands work better than others. If in doubt, bring crash pads and/ or toprope first. A stout lead, especially the onsight!   I disagree with what the new guidebook says about this and the route to the left...Switch the descriptions I'd say. This rig might feel more sustained.    Also, this climb and its neighbor to the left may feel hard for the grade OR perhaps many other 12's in the general vicinity are soft...    Pro: Most will be psyched on a double set of cams from .5\" to .75\" with 1 each to 1.25\".    This route is in the middle of the wall and the right of two crack/seam lines.    Do it!",

This is a fairly serious lead and would be an incredible on-sight for someone with the sufficient mental and physical strength.    The climbing is typical Milkman wall stuff - slightly over-hanging with some long reaches between good holds.  Start with hard moves off the deck to a bolt at about 15' (don't fall getting to it).  From the bolt, some more steep crimping takes you slightly left to a jug with good feet.  This is the best rest and allows you to place good gear from a nice stance.  Move up and right through a tough overlap to the Horrors Cave and then back left to a decent rest and another opportunity for gear.  You probably want to double up on the pro at this point since this is all you get.  The next few moves getting established on the head wall are pumpy but all there.  Keep a cool head and continue up on small but positive crimps -  the climbing eases off as you get higher but the run-out will keep your attention",

The climbs are mostly sport, but a few of Squamish's best trad lines are here. The sheer number of high quality hard sport climbs on this one crag is impressive: at least 6 at 5.13, 25 at 5.12, 21 at 5.11. Several newer 5.10s have been added to this cliff more recently to warm up on. The climbing style here - technical climbing on small edges with long reaches.The easiest climbs at Pet Wall are Heavy Petting Action and Cougar One Bite Brownie, both 10a, at the far western end of the cliff. Among the most popular Pet Walls climbs is Pleasant Pheasant at 5.10d. Burning Down the Couch at 5.11d is considered one of the best. Flingus Cling gets high marks as an introductory 5.12b and Flight of the Challenger is a trad testpiece at 5.12c and you might well see people on it.",

Aesthetic and unmistakable.The Challenger can be broken into two distinct sections, first a steep, juggy section, reminiscent of a sport climb without any bolts. The second section requires a more technical approach in the shallow flare above the overhang. A couple more big moves near the top deliver a final sting in the tail.Start from a sharp boulder and pull onto the very steep wall on good sidepulls to a jug. Power through some big moves on jams and slopey rails to a big flake and a decent rest. Another big move from the flake gets you established below the lip on a jug. Transition into the crack above the lip on powerful, and sometimes painful, fingerlocks.The crux for many...continue up the shallow flare with a very thin seam in the back, an experiment in balance and footwork that eventually eases off into a hand/fist crack and another decent rest....but its not over yet.

Here you get a very good shake and power up for the early crux. Using good underclings and finger locks bump your way over the bulge.The climbing sticks with you as you make some big moves through the next couple clips.

To here the route is around 13b and you\u2019ve certainly done the hardest moves of the climb.But it\u2019s not over as you still have a long 13a ish section of climbing above you. Power lay backing, a small down climb, more lay backing on a crazy tuffesc jug flake leads you to one last v2/v3 crux that could definitely spit off the desperately pumped and undeserving challenger right before the chains.

Thread on Squamish Climbing Form:   squamishclimbing.com/squami\u2026   P1 - Start on the right side of the base area and move towards the bolt on the left below the thin crack.  Climb the crack to the belay ledge.  This pitch doesn't see much sun and is a bit mossy.  The belay bolts are to the left, but look for the rap bolts about 50' to the right and remember to hit those on the way down. 20m pitch.   P2 - The money pitch.   Take either the left hand/fist crack or the right thin crack.  We took the left crack.   It's steep, solid jamming all the way to the undercling roof.   I had two #3s and one #4.   If you want to sew it up, bring another #4. There is a horizontal crack midway which helps with the gear.  The steep crack just below the crux undercling is #2/#3 camalot size, so save one of each for that section if you want to sew it up.  Bust out the undercling (crux for me) and pull around the roof.  Easy climbing leads to the bolts directly overhead. 25m pitch.   P3 - Move the belay down and to the right.   Launch up the gently overhanging handcrack for 40 feet (sweetness!) to the bolt protecting a weird step left.   Climb overlaps/underclings to the anchor, which is way up there. 30m pitch.   Descent:  Rap the route with a 60m route.   Hit the rap anchors about 50' of the belay bolts atop P1.   I almost missed them coming down, so keep your eyes out.",

(Honestly, you should buy it anyways to support quality guidebook writing.)Drive to the top of High Creek Drive in Valleycliffe and park. This is a residential neighbourhood so do not park on the street or in the cul-de-sac and use the various parking bays along the street. As you walk to the cul-de-sac at the top of High Creek Drive, there is a path on the left that travels up a hill, then up around the back of the homes on the west side of the street. After 2-3 minutes you should see a path that shoots up and right, this is the mountain bike trail Equinox. You are essentially going to follow Equinox for another 10 minutes or so uphill past a viewpoint until Rampage Rock appears on the right. Bourdon recommended using a mountain bike trail app to find and follow Equinox - I downloaded Trailforks and found it was very useful as the trail branches in several places. When you see a 15m tall half-dome of mossy cracks facing south behind a few trees, you've found it.",

It's easy to go too high after clipping the first bolt and miss the edges you're meant to follow. The book rates this as 5.10a while noting that it is hard for the grade, which I would agree with--it's a great exercise in techy traversing. To me it felt noticeably harder than Women in Comfortable Shoes, and the features are reminiscent of One Scoop or the last pitch of Hairpin.

Huge belay ledge.P3 - The money pitch. Climb the steep finger/hand crack until the little roof. While it looks like it should go up the corner, the climb tackles the short tight hand crack that angles right up the headwall. As that crack ends, step left onto a small ledge. Continue stepping left into the corner. The move stepping into the corner is a bit committing with your gear down and right of you (be sure to use slings). Find gear near the rock scar and make a face move out of the corner and slab up past a bolt to the top. The topo shows the crux as the face move exiting the corner, but I thought the crux was the angling hand crack. A long pitch, though the final 50' is easy.More details available at Squamish Climbing Forum",

Unfortunately, despite it being completed months before the publication of the new Select guide, it didn't make it in (for space reasons, I heard). Three pitches, each characterized by mostly straight-forward 5.8/5.9 crack climbing and distinct slabby crux sections that have a bolt at eye-level. If you aided each of the three bolts I'm sure it would go at 5.9 A0.    P1 (10-): Easy climbing up and left along some left-leaning crack systems. Mantle up into a no-hands rest, move up and left, then directly right underneath the bolt to some face moves. There's a positive water dimple you can get a few pads in, but my 5'6\" girlfriend had a harder time than I did reaching it. Felt 5.10- to me, 5.hard for her. Mantle and scramble up and right to chain anchors below a handcrack.   P2 (10+): Left-facing corner. This is the reason you're climbing this route, because you love plugging gold Camalots in slammer hand cracks like a boss. Some great jamming for the first half, then a tricky traverse left past a bolt, then up a thinner crack up and right to chain anchors. This is the crux pitch, the traverse again was really hard for my short partner, she had to aid past the bolt.    P3 (10): Start up and right through some easy climbing up a low-angle dihedral, grab some jugs and clip the bolt. A technical section follows up and left through some shitty finger locks and pinches up to a mini-jug. Onwards and upwards through easier ground and then up through an offwidth (I used a #4 Camalot, but it looks like there are bolts to the right you could mess around with up some features if you don't have anything wide.) Up some face moves to chain anchors.    We rapped off (3 raps with a 60), but apparently you can walk to the left from the anchor and join up with the descent trail. I can't testify to how easy that is, it didn't look particularly well-trodden today.   Good fun, obviously a ton of work went into scrubbing this route. That being said, the combination of some larger trees up high (which need a chainsaw) and the low traffic due to not being so well advertised is leading to a slow buildup of pine needles and leaves in the cracks. This needs traffic so it doesn't get overgrown again before the new McLane guide, so go climb it as a public service to all.

Make a tough move through a small roof and continue up on good finger locks to a 2nd, larger roof.  This roof is actually easier than the first - there is a rusty old pin under the overhang but a huge jug allows you to place a bomber cam over the roof.  Another 20' of easy climbing gets you to the anchor (35m)   P3 (10a):  Continue up the crack as it trends left, eventually it peters out and a bolt protects a face move to the anchors.  The guidebook has this pitch at 10d but there is no way....it is 10a at the most.  (25m).

P1 - Start up Centrefold and at the first bolt start traversing left.  Skip the intermediate anchor and go all the way to the nice ledge below the chimney/slot pitch of Papoose One.  Two bolts plus a variety of gear.  I placed a #3 on the way to the last bolt, but a #4 could be placed a bit higher.  Some fun \"walk the plank\" moves!  I ended up approaching the last bolt from below rather than foot traversing, but I'm not sure it was the easy way.     P2 - Great pitch of intriguing face climbing.  All bolted until the final short crack to the Hairpin anchor.   The moves across the traverse are really cool.     P3 - Easy 5.7 hand crack to the right, past the Papoose One belay, up to a new belay above the small roof.   P4 - Enjoyable and well protected face climbing all the to the top.  After the last bolt head up and trend right joining the finishing moves of Centrefold.

Beware the gigantic hollow flake on the ramp; you probably don't want to place pro behind it. 5.10b.p3: clip a bolt up and left from the anchor, then face climb left to good holds then up and back right to gain left leaning corner. Climb the corner to bulge with a bolted anchor above. The corner looks intimidating from below, but there are lots of face holds for feet, making it mostly ~5.8 after the crux start. 5.10a.p4: (not part of the original Pin Up route, but definitely recommended) climb left slanting thin crack first on gear and then three bolts.

                "description": "A bonafide legend of Squamish climbing, Carl Austrom pioneered much of the terrain around Shannon Falls, The Apron and more while leading onsite, hand drilling his way up into the unknown. He had placed hex-head rivets from free stances or hooks, requiring wired nuts to be slung over them as pro. A bold, unique style that most can only imagine as much of the stone was likely (even back then) covered in lichen and needed brushing, all while on the sharp end. While never reaching the top of this section of the wall he did indeed find some truly excellent climbing, primarily on dykes, in a picturesque setting and for that we all owe our respect.\u00a0This route has humbly been established using modern top-down tactics, searching for the best free-climbing line with a respect to the style of the wall. As far as locations of bolts, typically they are placed from good stances, and not as often on easier ground.Carls rusted rivets on the second pitch, part of a climb he called \u201cI Wanna Be Teased\u201d, were replaced one-for-one with modern stainless bolts. Start on a perfect granite ledge above the river.Pitch 1 (10d, 5 bolts + gear) From the ledge, climb up past a bolt to a horizontal break. Mantle up and climb a sustained, excellent dyke past bolts to the anchor.Pitch 2 (11c, 6 bolts + gear) \u201cI Wanna Be Teased\u201d \u00a0Continue up the beautiful dyke on easier ground to where the wall steepens. Move right to a good stance, clip a bolt, and pull the bouldery crux on small edges. Continue past a couple more bolts to the anchor. Carl had rated this pitch 11a when he did it in 1984, but a large broken flake stance at the crux has bumped the grade.Pitch 3 (10b, 3 bolts + gear) Climb dykes to the right and link into the \u201cDark Matter\u201d finger crack. Finish as for that pitch.Pitch 4 (11b, 12 bolts) Climb left along dykes across the wall to an increasingly exposed position above the falls. Sustained movement through amazing small pockets and edges on the face above lead to the top. Fully bolted, leave the rack at the belay.Rappel trending climbers right to reach an intermediate anchor, and rappel the rest of the route back to the base or to the Klahanie area. A 60m rope works well.",

It was fairly dirty when we climbed it, though I imagine we were one of the first parties of the season. Plenty of pine needles and detritus caught in the cracks, so take a nut tool as you climb.P1: Cardhu Crack. You'll want to climb past the Cardhu anchors up to a ledge with rap rings. (5.8, 45m)P2: Climb up and right, then traverse left along an easy hand crack on a ramp. Tree anchor. (5.6, 15m)P3: Climb right up a diagonal finger crack. The FAist describes this as a hand crack, but you'd need pretty small hands for that to be accurate. Balancy and tough - will get easier when it cleans up with more traffic, but will get harder again when the stumps eventually fall out. When clean, this will be a very nice line. Bolt anchor, belay in a hole. (5.10-, 25m)P4: The crux pitch is a beautiful and sustained line with tough, engaging climbing. Traverse right, clip a bolt, chimney up through easier ground on larger gear. Clip two more bolts as you begin tackling the main feature: a thin seam in a little mini-dihedral (like two inches of left-facing corner) . Looks improbable for the grade as the seam is almost slammed shut, but eventually the crack does open up slightly to take some small gear (yellow C3s to purple C3s). After your first piece of gear, tips locks and eventually a finger lock or two begin to reveal themselves as the angle eases up. The crack peters out at the top, so slab climb past 2 more bolts at a mid-10 grade.This pitch is very balancy and technical in nature. I'd read that you could easily aid through the thin section, but I don't know - you probably could aid through it with enough RPs, but this isn't a french-free-through-a-few-moves sort of pitch. Bolt anchor. (5.11-, 40m)P5: Climb a short, steep and juggy right-leaning crack to a tree above the belay. Slab and a cool dyke traverse up to the bolt-anchors. 2 bolts, and few cracks for gear every now and then. (5.9 - 35m)P6: Walk into the forest, then climb a fun, long and easy pitch. Starts off sporty, with many jugs and foot holds and lots of different gear options. As you climb higher, the pitch becomes lower angle and slabbier in nature. Near a bolt there is a 5.8 slab move. I think there was 2 bolts on this pitch, but there may have been 3. Bolt anchor. (5.8 - 40m).To descend, traverse left, then right up a ramp. From there a faint trail leads south to the Skywalker walk-off.",

Bolted belay. The FA party called this 5.7, but my partner and I both found it stiff for that grade.Pitch 2: The money. Jam up the hand-and-fist crack in a corner to a bolted anchor on a ledge.Pitch 3: Move the belay around the corner to the base of the bolted slab, then smear your way up this short pitch. 7 bolts, no trad gear needed. This will place you at the bottom of the Zen Garden proper, below Half Lotus.The route can be rappelled with a 60, but it is likely to become a fairly busy area, particularly since Gatekeeper shares the start--walking off is preferred.

The majority of the routes dry quite quickly after rain, but during especially wet periods one could assume some areas around\u00a0Soul Shakedown\u00a0and\u00a0Mettle Detector\u00a0as well as parts of the base routes may suffer from seepage.",

A nice way to get warmed up.Option 2 (direct and fastest) - Pick up the trail between the viewpoint and the Shannon Springs crag which trends steeply up and left along the base of the cliff. After a few minutes, watch for a gully system with a fixed hand line cutting back to the right. This direct trail is steep and can be wet. Tops out directly above \"Open Sesame\" and below \"Half Lotus\". 10-15 min.Option 3 (longer, but less steep)\u00a0- Continue along the base of the wall for 10-15 minutes and watch for 3 enormous Douglas Fir trees (hard to miss). slightly past these trees, a ledge system cuts back right under a roof feature. Continuing up from here leads towards the gondola, instead head back down along the top of the cliff you hiked next to and reach the crag in 1-2 minutes. Easiest to go this way with bouldering pads. 20-30 min.",

Follow the road uphill (you're in a watershed here) for a further 1.5 km, then turn right (400m after the bridge over the river) onto the Shannon Creek branch. This leads up steeply behind the Chief and eventually reaches a Forest Service Blockade, 9 km from the highway.

                "description": "This is an incredible route, with each pitch offering a different type of challenge.  You definitely get the whole spectrum of Squamish climbing in these 5 pitches.  P1 (10d):  This is the the 1st pitch of Straight Outta Squampton.  Climb easily up to a small roof and pull out left into a good flake. Follow the flake up and step right into a right-facing corner which leads to an intimidating little roof.  Go left around the roof and climb more thin cracks to a bolted belay (30m).  P2 (11a): Climb some face cracks above the belay and then move left into a wide undercling/chimney (the Hirvonen Slot).  Prepare for a full body pump as you grind your way up the flare.  There are 3 bolts and some gear in the back of the chimney.  At the top of the slot, move right to anchors (25m)  P3 (11b):  Follow thin cracks and make a series of left traverses.  The thin-hands crux comes towards the end just as you are losing steam.  This is an outstanding pitch and is quite sustained. (35m)  P4 (10b):  The climb changes character now  - this pitch face climbs up over a few bulges (20m).  P5 (11a):  The angle kicks back but now you'll need to make some slabby moves until you can join the last pitch of Photophobia.   Descent:  Rap straight down with a 70m rope.  You will end up descending climber's left of the Hirvonen slot.  If you have a 60m rope you can rap Photophobia.",

The other pitches are fine too and the crux pitch, move for move, may be harder, but the corner is certainly the focal point of this climb.   P1: Short, slightly flaring finger and thin hand crack. If the second pitch is .11d, this one is probably more like .10d or .11a. In any case, the crux is short lived.   P2: Bolted slab climbing leads to a tough move entering the corner. The crack in the clean, shallow corner is thin, incipient and the climbing very technical. The crux is even thinner and when the corner disappears you really have to battle it out to get the jams to stick. Classy!   P3: Three bolts protect a face that appears to blank out as it moves up and right towards a horizontal crack. This section is crimpy, but magical granite foot moves are the real key to success. The climbing eases above the horizontal and heads back left to another anchor.   P4: A short and slightly painful finger crack in a flare eases quickly to a fun thin hand crack.

One could easily rap the route with one 70m rope (possibly even a 60m if careful on the P2-P1 rap) or just as easily walk off as per the aforementioned routes or the Great Game/Drain.

Nuts provide extra options and are useful but may not be strictly necessary; I believe I placed a total of two on the climb and the RP's didn't get any use. Anchors are all bolted and equipped for easy rappels with a single 70m rope. The rock on Slhanay is coarsely grained with a lot of sharp quartz crystals; this climb is slightly painful at times and tape might be desirable, especially on P2.

                "description": "An interesting alternative to the more popular routes nearby, this route features face climbing and lots of boulder problems (or bolt ladders) over bulges with a couple of crack sections thrown in for good measure. The route would probably get more stars if it were a little cleaner in spots and if one freed all the bolt ladders. As we did this as an 'active rest day' route, we didn't attempt this and in fact freeing the second ladder appears fairly serious besides being difficult.   P1 (10a): Bolts interspersed with gear lead up the blunt buttress/arete between The Great Game and The Great Drain. A direct start slightly left appears dirty and runout.   P2 (10c or 11c): A0 or free the bouldery bolt ladder. Head up the slab to the large ramp on Great Game and belay at the bolted station near the tree stump.   P3 (10c or 12a R): A0 or free the bolt ladder. Free climbing consists of a difficult, thin bulge. It looks like you must then leave the bolt ladder at the third bolt and run out the slab above with a terrible landing on the ramp below if you fall. Pulling through instead, you climb the bolt line and angle left to a hand traverse into the corner, layback the crack, then head up to another bolted anchor.   P4 (10c or 12a): Another difficult bulge or A0 bolt pulls put you on a slab below another overlap with a crack. Move into the crack. The guidebook says that soon afterwards you move left in another crack across the slab to finish on the Right Wing corner and final steep wide pitch. The slab is dirty and I missed this option, continuing up and right in the main crack to a bolted belay. What could have been enjoyable 5.9 crack and slab is dirt-choked, mossy and kind of awful. A nut tool would have helped mine out the crack and a little brushing on the slab would greatly improve the pitch if climbed this way, making it a nice alternative to joining Right Wing.   P5: Ordinarily, this would be the .10d 'beak' pitch of Right Wing. What we did was to slab climb past two bolts and traverse a crack to join Skyline Arete (.11a) where you pull on a bolt (or mantle?) over the bulge and do some tricky moves onto the final slab. There's another bolt line with black painted hangers that continues straight above the initial slab that looks dirty but intriguing. This appears to be part of another route that shares the bolted part of P3 with Godforsaken Land and climbs some amazing terrain to the right before rejoining where we belayed below our final pitch. The pitch joining Skyline Arete was the best pitch on the route and if the link crack was cleaner, would be a great alternate P5 for Godforsaken Land.",
                "location": "Start on the buttress between Great Game and Great Drain, passing two bolts. Belays are bolted and it appears that one could fairly easily rap using the black painted anchors, perhaps even with a 70m rope. Having not attempted this, in preference it's better to walk off which is pretty easy and probably faster anyway.",
                "protection": "Mostly bolts, but gear is necessary too. How necessary depends on whether or not one finishes on Right Wing, in which case it might be nice to have a larger cam or two. The way we went, a lighter rack works. I can't remember if I ever used the #3 (Camalot) but I doubt it.

                "description": "Halley\u2019s Comet is an excellent splitter crack climb located on the left side of Dog Wall. This prominent line has caught the eye of many Squamish climbers, especially the residents of Valleycliffe who cannot help but gaze at the steep rock faces above their homes. It was first climbed on September 26, 1985 by Joe Turley and Ted Marks. Over the course of a week, they climbed it ground up, mainly on aid, cleaned the route, and then freed the 60 meter crack in two pitches. Joe being the more proficient crack climber of the team, climbed the first pitch and Ted led the second. Joe and Ted were amateur astronomers and named the route after Halley\u2019s Comet because of their anticipation for its upcoming apparition in the following year. Several generations of tat and fixed gear provided evidence of occasional ascents before the crack was reclaimed by our rainforest and fell into obscurity. This classic splitter likely grew over due to its adventurous nature. It was originally approached from the left, which involved 4th class to low 5th scrambling through a vertical forest. Halley\u2019s Comet now has a new first pitch that provides a pleasant and friendly approach to the base of the long finger and hand crack.

A cruxy finger crack is passed before the cracks zigs to the right and up to a ledge.  This ledge has a chain belay, but the climb continues for another 30 feet so you have the choice of doing it as one pitch or breaking it up.   Either way, the climb gets harder at this point and the corner crack above the ledge doesn't take good pro until you have made a few moves, but you can protect the moves off the ledge with a .75 camalot in a crack to the right of the corner.   Very strenuous climbing, but with good, if tough to place, gear finishes the climb up the corner.",

It is broken into an upper (left) and a lower (right) area separated by a short stretch trail.   There appear to be quite a number of new routes here too recent to to be in the 2005 McLane guide book.  Most are on the lower crag, although there is one very grim looking bolted slab on the upper crag.   New route descriptions are likely in the new route binder at Climb On on Squamish.  One new route is on the left side of the lower crag and is distinguished by being just right of the dirty gully and having two or three bolts in the thin and slabby upper half.  It's reasonably fun and goes at about 10c.",

It's a nice Bluffs bolted climb that is not a slab climb, and the crux is short and soft for the grade.    There is some definite ledge fall potential at the crux. Apparently there used to be a midway anchor to help mitigate this, but it was removed.    Three ways to start this climb:  1) Climb the first 20 feet of Fishy Business (10d, most direct). Bring a small cam, maybe like metolius 0 or 1, to protect against ground fall. Otherwise, this has one bolt with some spicy moves getting up to it.  2) Climb a two bolt slabby mantle further to the right.   3) Climb up the initial corner of Up Up and Away. This is the easiest way to get to the base, maybe 5.7, wouldn't recommend placing any gear in the corner though for rope drag reasons.   Once you're on the big ledge below the arete, the line and it's six bolts become obvious. The crux is moving past the second.   If you lower off the top with a 60, tie knots.

Start from the ground and go directly up to the crack by passing a rotten roof.  Now listed in the guidebook at 10d, although I had done it prior to the book's publication and had noted 10c in my previous edition.  10d sounds good since the second time I tried it, while it was seeping, I couldn't commit to the moves.

After the third bolt, top the next ramp and follow fairly obvious (5.6-5.7?) movements to the anchors, possibly finding a placement around X4 0.3-0.4 before the anchors. You certainly do not want to fall during the easier movements leading to the anchors, as there is no 4th bolt as indicated in the guide book.You may find a C3 00 placement in the thin vertical flaring slot above the lower crack side-pull before stepping up to commit to the slab, but by no means is it a good placement. A small offset may prove more useful.The guide book does not denote a PG13 rating, but it is safe to say that if the vertical slot piece described above pops before you pull to the easy ramp and clip the first bolt, you are likely in ground-fall territory.

Expect fairly solid finger jamming to a well-defined crux where the crack peters out.    Beta alert: I received the excellent advise to dispense with pro through the crux section. Simply load up the crack before the crux and punch through the crux moves without thinking of pro. After the crux, you should get a pretty good stance from which to place gear. The crux is pretty short and the gear before it is very solid.",

However, it's also a four star experience if you're willing to risk the choss and spider webs. How often do you get to climb through a hole and emerge out into the sunlight? Super fun, burly, and dirty! Felt harder than 5.8 to me.\u00a0Be very careful what you pull on as there are many loose and jiggly rocks including a\u00a0very big chunk of rock on the left side of the crux\u00a0that seems like it could slide of pretty easily since it made grinding noises when touched. Should probably be trundled before being climbed if it's as loose as it sounded. See photo of loose block in the image attached. If you do climb it just be careful of this block and avoid it at all costs, and at the crux it would be better to go right and avoid touching or putting pro around this block.",

The name is appropriate: the angled nature of the feature and the smooth wall below conspire to have you placing pro from strenuous stances with your left foot smearing. The pro is in oddly shaped and poorly oriented cracks so while it requires care to place well you don't have luxury of hanging out forever.  I sprinted through it and got quite pumped.   The cobwebs seemed to indicate that it wasn't popular, probably because it couldn't be top-roped easily and it's a solid lead for the grade.",

All this suggests that stick-clipping is a very good idea, but you may be able to climb MCM to the height of the bolt and traverse over to it.

If you ever find yourself on top of a route on Octopus Garden crag, walk straight back away from the edge. You will likely pass Christopher's wooden memorial bench and then a path (left to right). We suggest you take the right but immediately hop on one of the mountain biking trails on the other side, and start trending rightwards. If you hit a biking trail that goes straight back (or back/left) you will hit Skunk Hollow (pictured in the new squamish select). If you trend more rightward, you will end up arriving at Themyscira. It should only be a 5 - 10 min walk from the top of Octopus Garden. If it's longer, retrace your steps and try again.",

If the ice is there, the routes will be obvious.P1 - WI3-4, 30m - Climb up what can be a steep pillar for about 10 meters before topping out onto a low angle ledge and then rambling up easy ice to a tree belay.P2 - WI3, 70m - Climb one long rope stretcher start with a steeper step into easy ice, finishing with another steeper step to a tree belay with a bunch of tat. Rappel here if you have double 70s or take it to the top.P3 - WI2-3, 20m - Climb a shorter pitch into the woods (may need to finish by pulling on some bushes to get over the final rock) and belay off a tree.If you took it to the end, unrope and bushwack traversing directly climber's right through the trees until you come across a trail that runs along the left side of Shannon Falls.

The cliff sees moderate filtered sun from mid morning onwards.All of the routes are fully fixed with steel chains and steel carabiners on every bolt, as well as all anchors. A 40m rope will safely get you down from all the routes. All hardware was supplied by the developer, as well as a few friends who helped contribute financially to the endeavor.The choice to develop this cliff for dry tooling was made with the understanding that it would not provide for good rock climbing. The quality of rock is simply such that it would remain dirty, and small holds would continuously break. You will find many holds have been enhanced (drilled), particularly in the areas of lesser quality rock. This is to prevent holds from repeatedly \u201cblowing out\u201d under the force of picks. Efforts have been made to clean as much of the loose rock as feasible, however, rockfall remains a possibility. Helmets are highly recommended, and standing underneath climbers should be avoided when possible.Many routes seep extensively over the winter, especially the steepest ones through the central roof. During our coveted arctic outflows, unsupported ice features form along the top. None of the routes have yet to see a true mixed winter ascent, but it is foreseeable that conditions will permit for this in the future. If you are climbing here when ice is present, be aware of your surroundings and continually assess for overhead hazards!All first ascents were completed while wearing crampons. Climbing in rock shoes is certainly possible and would feel easier.Topo HERE",

For full value, do the connection entirely on foot. This link-up has very likely been done before, and probably with much harder variations. I include it here as a resource for other people who might be interested in a fun long day out. As there are multiple moderate routes up each of the formations listed, you can have a lot of creative freedom with the style and difficulty, as well as the pitch count. 5.10a is about as easy as it gets, as Hairpin and Jungle Warfare are the easiest routes up their respective formations.\u00a0\u00a0Start at the Papoose. Climb Hairpin (5p, 10a). Walk off, then hike up to the base of the Shannon Falls Wall. Climb Spirit of Squamish (8p, 5.8). Descend, then take the connector trail up to the Chief campground, and walk down to the pedestrian overpass connecting the Grand Wall parking lot to the Malamute. (If you're not pressed for time and want to add a bit more fun jamming to your day, stop by the Bulletheads and run up Slot Machine. For full value, do it in one pitch) Descend the Malamute via the Stooge Slab and Grub Street rappels. Climb Old Style into Cider Crack, traversing left past a bolt just before Midway Ledge to access the base of the Starr Wall (I had a mini epic trying to find the correct spot to traverse--an alternate finish would be to just continue up Grubber's Highway by climbing Sodbuster). Finish it up by climbing the mega-classic High Mountain Woody to the top of the formation (3p, 10a). Hike back to the Grand Wall parking lot and take the Apron Connector down the hill to the Apron lot. Walk over to Rambles and climb it (4p 5.8-), then walk over to Over the Rainbow (6p 5.9+). Smear your way up to Broadway Ledge and scramble off climber's right. Upon arriving back at the Apron lot, stroll up the Mamquam Forest Service Road until you reach the clearing through which Slhanay is visible (about 1.5 km). Hike steeply up to the wall, then climb Jungle Warfare (5p 10a). After topping out, locate the descent trail about 30m above the final anchor and hike off.\u00a0You're done! If it's still light out, go take a dip in the Mamquam or get celebratory beers in town--you've climbed a fair bit of rock and hiked around 8 km (including walk-offs)!",

The wildly thin flake is very interesting and makes the easy climbing into a bit of a unique experience.  While McLane's guidebook calls it two pitches, it's easily done in one with a 70m rope and probably a 60m (although being wrong in this case would be a shame since the crux is the very first move which makes simul-climbing unappealing).

Move a few feet to the right to get to a left-facing dihedral. Make a tricky move to get into the corner and climb it until some flakes are encountered (maybe 40 or 50 feet). Climb the flakes but trend to the right to a sloping ledge with several cracks above it. Make a gear belay here.

Pitch 2 (5.8): climb a steep hand crack, move slightly left on cracks, and climb a face with intermittent cracks and pods until you can see a two-bolt anchor. Traverse a few feet to the right to that anchor. Verbal communication with your second will be difficult from the top of the second pitch because of road noise and your second being out of sight.

                "description": "This route is a stellar way to climb a ton of hard friction slab without frazzling your nerves with mind-frying runouts. It's not always a sport climb and there are certainly places where a fall would be undesirable, but it's better protected than many of the other Apron slabs: no three bolt .10c pitches here. Most of the pitches are 5.11 and your feet and toes will remember the continuous nature of the climbing for at least a few days afterwards. The .12d is completely optional as it's a short, steep boulder problem you can easily pull through.P1 (.11b): Right off the bat, 'warm up' on a very thin mossy slab that climbs out of the forest above a downed tree. You can start from under/behind the tree but the slab is pretty dirty lower down. I started from a ledge a little higher. As the select book states, it is a rather cruel warmup.P2 (.10b): Much easier and shorter slab. Belay amongst trees on the ledge.P3 (.10d): Climb the well-protected slab directly above. 50m long, this pitch feels harder than some of the later .11a pitches. Very sustained. Ends just below Snake.P4 (.11a): Cross Snake and angle right. Slightly thinner at one point but much shorter than the previous pitch.P5 (.11d): The business. Move right, then up until you encounter a steepening, thin section. Turn on the magic footwork switch, weld your feet to some miniscule features and hope for the best. Doesn't ease up much until you're clipping the anchor.P6 (.11a): The guide says .11b; feels more like .10c-.11a at most, maybe because it's much, much easier than the previous pitch.P7 (.11a): Feet hurting yet? Another thin, low-angle slab leads up to a belay below a steeper section of slab.P8 (.11b or c?): The guide bills this as another non-descript .11a but I found it to be a major 'sting in the tail'. A bleak bulge of 5.11 glacier glass in the middle of the pitch with a little too much sun on it felt much, much harder than all but the crux slab pitch. Perhaps this is instead the '.11b with a bulge' described as P6 or perhaps my feet were just tired by this point.P9 (.12d or .9 A0): Glassy and beautiful glacier polish leads to the short, steep headwall. Checking out the moves briefly seemed to put the section at about V6 or so. Bolts are right in your face, so go for it! Dirt on the slab above made the subsequent easier climbing a bit scarier.P10 (.10a): I think I may have combined this with P9 but I can't recall. In any case, the climbing remains easier but becomes more and more dirty. If I'd had a brush, 10 minutes would have been enough to create an improved path through the thickening murk.",
                "location": "Approach as for Diedre but before the trail goes up to the slippery V-groove, head left on another fork. Almost right away, you'll see the big downed tree against the wall. Start right off the ground behind/on top of the tree and fight through moss for two or three bolts, or scramble up a little on the left and step onto the slab there. Rapping the route is an option but P3 is 50m and trailing a second rope would make the climbing less enjoyable. If completing the route, walk off Broadway Ledge as for other Apron routes.",
                "protection": "Bolts. The guidebook says P3 has 11 so you could get away with, say, 12 quickdraws including some slings for meandering around.

I brought some small cams but didn't use a single one save for a green Camalot as a belay piece since I started P1 a little ways off the ground to miss the grunge. All belays are bolted.

North-facing and great for hot days - you can make it to the top of the Apron and barely see the sun at all.(Pitch lengths are all estimated)P1 (5.9, ~10m, 2 bolts) Start up a fixed line to a small platform with a bolt just above your head. Clip it and pull onto the face. Kind of odd and awkward climbing, clip another bolt and you're done.There is a 10a direct start that looks thin and adds another 10m or so of climbing to this pitch by avoiding the fixed line and climbing directly up to the first bolt.P2 (5.9, ~35m) Easy climbing to a short roof below a flake, then wider climbing at a low angle - hands, fists and a few stacks. You could place a #5 if you were so inclined, but we found a single #3 and single #4 were fine for this pitch.P3 (5.7, ~35m) Climbs fast, similar to P5 of Calculus Crack in nature.P4 (5.7, ~40m) Beautiful, clean climbing. You can choose to climb the hands splitter or the hands corner. Easy until the top, where it steepens slightly.P5 (5.easy, ~25m) Easy climbing, again choose between a face crack or a corner crack.P6 (5.7, ~35m) Layback up a handcrack to an interesting set of roof moves, traversing underneath a roof. Fun.P7 (5.8, ~45m, 4 bolts) Finesse up a thin left-leaning crack. Slightly awkward to place gear - bolts help protect you through the thin sections. This pitch will take you to the top of Calculus & St. Vitus - you can sling a tree to belay, or continue up to the belay bolts before the gulley next to Karen's Math that takes you to the rest of Broadway Ledge.If you want you can walk off at this point, or rappel Bad Pants Party into the South Gulley.P8 - (5.7) Continue up easy, low angle crack climbing through some interesting features.P9 - (5.8) Up a finger crack, then continue more vertically through some challenging ground, avoiding Memorial Crack. I found this pitch more challenging than the first two. Finish on bolt anchors on the top of a boulder (same boulder that marks the end of Memorial Crack, but the LTNS anchors are climber's left.Several of these pitches could be logically linked, we linked P3 & P4 (too short for a 70m, we had to belay at a tree 5m below the anchors), P5 & P6, and P8 & P9. If I were to do it again I'd link P1 & P2, P4 and P5, P6 and P7, P8 & P9.More info here:  squamishclimbingmagazine.ca\u2026Rappel Descent:If rapping from pitch 9:R1: Climb over the belay rock to the ledge, walk to climbers right on the slab just outside the trees. \u00a0There's a tree with a bunch of tat that works for a 70. \u00a0(Not sure if it works for a 60, please update if you know. \u00a0There's also a set of chains just over the edge that might be needed for a 60.) \u00a0Rap puts you on Broadway ledge, a big ledge full of trees about level with and climber's right of memorial ledge. \u00a0From here the walkoff is on climber's right and further rappels on climber's left.R2: Walk to climbers left through a bit of dirt to some chains. Rappel down to the same ledge as the end of P7. Instructions for the rest of the rappel below.If rapping from pitch 7 ledge (this would be raps 3-6 if coming from P9):R1: The rap anchors are further down the slab on climber's left, by two little trees. \u00a0Large chain from bolts (15m)R2: Chain anchor station part way down the wall on a ledge (35m)R2.5: If have a 60, there is a single bolt with a locker to the right for the remaining 5mR3: Large chain anchor off tree (28m)R4: Bolted anchor (25m)Walkoff Descent:If coming from the pitch 9 ledge complete the first rap to get to Broadway ledgeIf coming from the pitch 7 ledge, scramble up & left via a fixed line to gain a prominent right-angling 4th class gully system. scramble up this (passing memorial ledge on your left) to its terminus, you're on Broadway ledge.On Broadway ledge, follow the well traveled path to the right till it peters out above some slab. \u00a0Complete an exposed traverse trending slightly down with a jug rail for your hands and a short section of thin feet (those squeamish about exposure may want rock shoes on for this). \u00a0A short remaining traverse/downclimb will put you above the top of Diedre. \u00a0Continue south along the trail/gully system to reach the nice trail in the trees that will eventually deposit you on the Apron Connector trail south of the Apron parking lot. \u00a0Walkoff takes 1h30-2h.",

This relatively new Apron climb manages to stay very sustained at 5.8 and 5.9, without venturing into 5.10a for more than a move or two.  It's mostly bolted, but some cams are pretty much mandatory, and you'll have a piece or bolt no more than 20 feet below you, which sounds good on paper, but keeps you honest when it's for real, but isn't anywhere near as bad as some of the Apron friction horror shows.   P1: Start as for Diedre but at the horizontal break follow about three bolts to a two-bolt anchor in a concavity. (5.9)   P2: Climb left and then back right following the line of least resistance and a couple of bolts into some easier terrain to the next two-bolt anchor. (5.8+)   P3: While it will be tempting to link this with P2, reconsider.  This pitch is the most sustained on the route, although maybe not the crux.  Four bolts take you to a section where the dishes and edges have disappeared and you are back to pure friction, but on a slightly more amenable angle.  Sticking a cam into the undercling crack on the left will feel good (the crack is a part of the route Sickle).  Continue right (possible belay here) and pull the overlap at the tree.  A bolt protects one more thin move to the Sickle Ledge. (5.9)   P4. Move the belay to the middle of the ledge, just below the continuation of the bolt line.  Follow the bolts to an unclinging arch (a few cams, many options for size).  Get above the arch and continue along the bolt line. (5.10a)   P5. Slab climbing is about subtlety and here the rock undergoes a subtle change which gives this climb some interesting variety.  It's a minor change, but just as you've dialed-in the friction on the previous pitches, you have to adjust for the more textured but steeper rock here.  The line is obvious given the bolts and scrubbed texture. (5.10a)   P6. A fairly short pitch of 5.6 takes you to Broad way ledge.  Can definitely be linked with P5 with a 70m rope, and likely with a 60m (but not certain).   McLane calls this route 7 pitches, likely due to breaking up P3, but this doesn't seem necessary.  Most parties will do it in 5 pitches (as described above plus linking the last two).

Very casual, but if 5.8 is your limit you may want a #4 for the beginning (this is definitely not necessary though.) 5.7, 40m. (I recommend linking p3+p4 if you're not placing much gear).Many people rappel from here, making it a fun and chill 5.8 outing.P5: While the climbing feels casual until this point, it definitely begins to feel a little more wild if you continue. This pitch is classic Apron slammed-shut corner climbing on slabby feet, with 5 bolts to make you feel more comfy. Climb a right-facing corner system, clip a bolt, continue left up a low-angle face with good holds past 2 bolts, then mantle into another right-facing corner system. The challenges of thin fingers and slabby feet continue as you climb right up an arch past 2 more bolts, then downclimb a few moves to a hidden set of chains. 30m, 10-.Rappel from here, making sure to rappel past the last belay station to a rap station on the face. Three more raps get you to the ground. You can rap with a 60m, but there are some rope-stretching raps so be sure to tie knots.Squamish Climbing Magazine\u00a0ArticleGripped Article",

                "description": "p1. A few dirty moves off the ground get you past a tree with exposed roots and into beautiful clean granite corners and cracks.  A fun 5.8 crux makes you layback or fist jam.   p2. Step out left from the belay and climb the clean corner or undercling a crack a little further left (both seem to be graded the same, but left feels easier).  A few blocky sections then lead to a perfect belay ledge.   p3. This 5.9 pitch is awkward and strenuous, starting with a solid couple of layback moves into a flaring crack.  After a few moves in the crack you can move onto the left wall and pass tough moves with good protection. Traverse far left under the roof and across a steep gully to a bolted belay.   p4. The long crux pitch starts with an intimidating corner.  Three small nuts can be placed to protect this corner -- take your time and place them well.  The difficulty eases and then gradually ratchets back up as you work up a steepening corner to a 10a mantle crux.  Climb ten more feet past the crux to a very cool belay.  I've done this route twice a group of three and this belay is tight for two, but possible if no one minds getting cozy.   p5. This pitch can be linked with the previous one.  It's short but burly.  Three cams (camalots 0.5, 1, and 2) are entirely sufficient for the entire pitch (so if you have just led p4 and have those pieces, keep going).   p6. If you belayed after pitch 4, just link this one with p5.  This 5.7 pitch leads to the trees.     Either continue up the Squamish Buttress or The Ultimate Everything, or descend by walking along the treed ledge to a bolted rap station that will drop you in the Memorial Ledge swimming pool (only by carrying the loose end of the rope with you  will you have a chance of keeping it dry).

Hike the gully until looking back and right you can see a left facing corner system running the height of the cliff. It's not visible until you are a little past it.

                "description": "This route is a variation to the first three pitches of the classic Rock On and can be done in one super-long pitch with a 70m rope, but is most commonly done in two pitches, saving the crux for the second pitch. After clipping a pair of bolts low on the first pitch, the climb ascends a corner system just left of Rock On. You will pass an anchor about ninety feet off the ground as you make your way up to a second anchor another seventy feet up. The climbing is characterized by stemming and laybacking in corners with finger cracks. The cruxes are short, with one layback corner crux and the other being the final small overhang, both clocking in around 5.10a. The second pitch is about eighty feet long and tackles the crux roof above the anchor. The finger crack in the back of this roof is somewhat thin and challenging for folks with large fingers. Once you pull the roof the fingers get progressively better until you are rewarded with jugs another ten or fifteen feet later. This pitch clocks in at a solid 5.10c and reminded me of the crux of Blazing Saddles somewhat.   Overall I find this variation to be a worthy alternative to Rock On when conditions are right. Some folks may find it a bit dirtier than its neighbor, but the climbing is top notch.",

P2. About 40-50' above belay head left toward small trees( if you go up slab it is a run-out 10b variation) cross several overlaps angle back right toward big tree island and left facing corner.   P3. Either go straight up using water pockets, or descend corner( original route) maybe 20' till you can go up obvious crack which peters out to a tricky slippery slab move up to big tree covered ledge.   P4. It can be confusing here which bolted line to follow. If you took the original route below it is the first line of bolts you come to going up the ledge to your left, but maybe hard to spot bolts. The 2nd bolt line is the Delicious Dimples ( 10c) with more newer bolts. If you go all the way to your left you will hit the Over the Rainbow bolts.   P5.

The offwidth section barely takes a #4 camalot; it's badly tipped out at a few points as you slide it up.  Adding a #4.5 camalot, and doubles in the .75, #1,  #2 and #3 sizes would allow you to sew it up.  Thanks to variations in parallel cracks and the way it pinches down in the back, you can often leave behind a nut and save a cam.  After 50m you get to a nice ledge with one bolt which can be backed up with a variety of cams (much trickier with nuts).

Or rap from Wild Turkey( no chain ) with a double rope to the level of the 5.9 traverse to the Fight Club anchor. Or go to the top of the Bullet , find bolted anchor facing Tantalus wall and rap into the South/south Gully ( 2-3 single rope raps down to Turkey ledge level in gully. Or find anchor on north end of the Bullet and make single rope rap to ledge and anchor of the top of Fight Club, then another single rope rap to top of Ren, and one more to Turkey ledge area. The anchor down and right of Turkey ledge and Eurasian Eyes ( start of 5.9 traverse to Wild Turkey ) could be used to make double rope raps down to base of wall.

Sometimes a single section of a climb defines a route, and sometimes a single word defines that section.  For this climb, that word is smooth.  Or traverse.  Or unprotectable.  Take your pick.   P1.  Begin from a cedar groove that leads to a suprisingly airy, bolted arete.  Climb the arete to a stance at the base of a dike.  Some gear is needed near the top of the arete.  Stiff 5.8.   P2.  Follow the dike up and left on easy terrain.     Occasionally sparse but adequate gear.  Belay at bolts on the left of the arete.  5.4   P3.

Cruise up the two fixed handlines to the base of the Slot machine. Women in comfortable shoes starts about 60 feet to the left.   Woman in comfortable shoes 10a  p1 10a \u0096 go straight right (back towards Slot machine) following a small dyke feature for your feet, and occasional micro crimps for your hands. A tough start to the day, especially for the outside of your left foot.  p2 8 \u0096 Continue right past a bolt and over the top of slot machine (optional #2 camalot), when reaching the offwidth flake, head up another 15 feet to the anchor. A short pitch.  p3 10a \u0096 continue up small crack for about 10 feet, then head out onto the slab for some good ol fashioned padding. Share the anchor at the top of slot machine.  Xenolith dance 10b  p4 10b \u0096 a very fun pitch, but sustained. Follow the series of nubins, edges, and pockets out and left then straight up to the anchor.  p5 10a \u0096 some additional nubbins lead to padding to the top. A nice finish for this two pitch section.   Walk up the obvious trail and then head off to the left towards the main face of the grand wall. The trail ends at that fixed line across an exposed 15ft ledge getting you to a bolted anchor.   Land of freedom 10a  p6 10a \u0096 start in a dirty corner with roots and a tree stump. Clip two bolts then take a delicate step out and left to get to another diagonal dyke that heads up and to the left. Continue on to the anchors and enjoy the view.   Continue up the obvious trail up and left until you find a fixed rope that takes you up a 6 foot cliff band. Climb the old ratty rope and continue left for another 20 feet to the obvious flake.   Moonwatcher 9  p7 9 \u0096 Climb up the crack using nice jams and good feet (optional #2 camalot). Clip the bolt and move out onto the face up to the tree anchor at the top.   Continue hiking up and left towards a nice trail at the top of Tantulus wall. While quite exposed, flip-flops worked just fine for the hike. Find the correct trail to get you out onto Bellygood. There is a set of anchors in the corner.   Belly good ledge 5.root-pull  p7a \u0096 not really much of a pitch, but the first 5-10 feet are a little airy and dirty. After that, walk the ledge out past a bolt until you reach the anchors at the base of millennium falcon (near a tree, ~120 feet).   The next three pitches provide the hardest climbing on the route, with good distances between bolts.   Millennium falcon 10c  p8 10a \u0096 a nice pitch, although there is some distance between the bolts. Head up and right following generally good holds. The pitch is fairly sustained, but there are good rests in-between the individual cruxes.  p9 10c \u0096 the crux pitch of the route. Head out right then back left on some delicate edges to a large crack. Follow the crack for another ~30 feet of fairly easy climbing (#2 camalot optional). Make the step up on the large block before you can clip the bolt, then head out and right to some difficult moves over a jagged roof.   The universal key 10b  p10 \u0096 a hard and sustained pitch, some distance between bolts. Start up the dihedral with positive but reachy holds till the roof above your head forces you out and to the right. A difficult padding move gets you onto a dirty ledge. Continue right until you hit the first of two cracks. Make an exciting step across (again, very reachy) then head up to a surprising finish. I thought the was the hardest pitch on the route.   Traverse of the gods 9  p11 \u0096 start by walking left on a nice ledge until it pinches off and you are forced onto the slab. Pad across the slab until reaching the start of a dyke feature passing the first set of anchors you see, stopping at the second belay. Described in the guidebook at 5.9, it\u0092s really a 5.8 (see next pitch)  p12 \u0096 continue on the dyke feature passing bolts that are very hard to see until you are almost on top of them. The climbing has a very similar feel to women in confortable shoes, just a grade easier. Traverse to the black dyke, then head up and left to an anchor below a large roof near a tree. Described in the guidebook as 5.8, its really fairly sustained 5.9.   The upper black dyke 10a  p13 \u0096 head out onto the main black dyke feature climbing \u0093exit 38\u0094 style rock, clipping bolts along the way. The crux of the pitch is no particular move, rather its finding the good holds that allow you to move up. Watch for the loose rock not only for your partner, but the several routes below on the main grand wall.   Continue up and left to Penthouse Wall. Walk past a memorial to Mr. Ciechanowski, then take a short fixed handline down to the trail. The first route you come to (about 30 feet) is the next pitch.   Mr. Ciechanowski 10a  p14 - (right most route on the Penthouse). Easier than it looks, follow nice jugs over the roof to a nice series of edges up to the anchor. Reachy again.   Walk left to Raven's Castle (starting on the very far left side and up a gulley, start out the dyke heading across the wall)   Joe's Dyke 5.6  p15 \u0096 easy padding past a few bolts. A short pitch. You can start waving at the tourists from here on.   Ladies First 10a  p16 \u0096 Head out and left from the anchor to a small ramp that leads to a flake. This pitch provides a little sting in the tail of a nice long route.",

                "description": "Completely panned in McLane's guidebook as wet and rated 5.9 A2, it has recently been cleaned and freed at 10+. The first three pitches are good, but it's the final pitch that gives it the three stars. The final pitch is a 70m rope-stretching epic that deserves its own name.   We encountered a bit of wetness in a few unfortunate spots. It probably needs two weeks of warm weather without rain to be completely dry.   Tape gloves are highly recommended.   Pitch 1: This pitch is a thinker. Several different ways of doing it are possible. Follow the left facing crack to a tricky layback move. From here you could probably go left, but I found that right, up, and then left worked for me. Once on the left-trending overlaps you can choose to stay on one or move up and and down between them as you work your way to the ramp left of the first bolt. Clipping the first bolt requires committing to tough slab feet (maybe not if you're 6'6\"). From there keep going past the second bolt after which the grade eases to 5.9 and runs out a good 20 feet to the corner. Build a belay in the corner. Several 5.10+ cruxes. Watch for rope drag. 30m.   Pitch 2: Climb awkwardly right off the belay under an overlap to a good stance below a left facing flare. The back of the flare takes ok gear and good fist/hand jams, but is deep enough that it's very difficult to move off the jams. The left wall was wet so we pulled on the gear. Dry it's probably thuggish 10. A wide left facing crack leads up and turns into an undercling to an obvious belay alcove. 5.10, 20m.   Pitch 3: Step around the little roof above the belay alcove and head up into the chimney. Place gear as high as possible in the chimney (#3 Camalot), and then downclimb until you can get outside the chimney and make offwidth moves to get above the chimney. It helps to arrange your gear so it's not in the way. The rest of the pitch is probably 5.8 or 5.9, but quite long and finishes with a very pretty finger crack to a treed ledge. It might be possible to take the corner right of the finger crack, but it didn't look well traveled or anywhere near as nice. 5.10, 30m.   Pitch 4: This pitch is obvious from the belay ledge. It goes straight up the amazing face and finishes left of the obvious headwall. It is a FULL 70m and has no fixed gear. It will take tons of gear -- the key is not running out. Use nuts to preserve cams. The line is quite straight but it's so long you want to use runners to keep drag at an absolute minimum. Just when you think you have it made, there's one hard move to get established in the final corner, but it quickly eases off after that. Keep going right to the forest. There are several distinct cruxes and lots of continuous jamming between them. It would be possible to stop at less than 60m, just below the headwall if using a 60m rope or out of gear (but you would need some for the belay). 5.10+, 70m!",
                "location": "Walking north along the trail from the Campground Wall you will pass Rainy Day Dream Away, and then Bullethead East (also recently cleaned). The trail splits around a block. Take the right fork (or left and then double back). From a nice flat spot on the trail you can look up to see the route. The roof capping the fourth pitch is a good landmark, as are the two bolts at the top of the first pitch (they aren't immediately obvious though, and you will probably only see one).   From the top of the fourth pitch, the trail (regardless of whether rappelling or walking down) is about thirty feet into the brush.   It's supposed to be possible to descend by rappelling Wild Turkey, but there were only bolts, no chains or rings, at the top of that route. There was a station with chains heading down into the gulley that separates the Bulletheads from the Tantalus wall, but we elected to descend by following the obvious trail system south. Along the trail there is a fixed line that goes down a steep gulley. Belaying or rappelling it will ease the anxiety level, but it's not necessary as long as the fixed line is in good condition.",

Belay at a gear anchor with rap webbing at your feet. You'll be in an awkward fix when your second arrives.Continue straight up, enjoying the view of the forest as you squeeze up the chimney and out the roof to the left to a bolted anchor.

        "description": "Describes the roped climbing on the gigantic boulders amongst the Grand Wall boulders. Located minutes from the parking adjacent to the old highway roadbed that is historically referred to as Psyche Ledge. Lots of history here. Long before the advent of bouldering this area was primarily a used as a a bivy spot in the caves formed by the jumbled blocks. It was also the scene of a number of \"practice\" aid routes that likely went up in the desperate rainy days long ago...the most famous of these climbs being Rurp Riot the top of which became Dreamcatcher, interestingly nearly half of the existing sport climbs were ascended as aid routes in the '60s and '70's. A quirky sidenote was the building of a completely manufactured sport wall in the late 80's the drilled pockets are still evident on the smooth, steep east face. Considered an abomination now, and by many at the time, the protagonists were trying to create a rainproof training wall in an already heavily abused piece of rock. At the time there was no such thing as a climbing gym, and personal spray walls and moonboards were science fiction. During the birth of sport climbing in the early 90's, Squamish visionary Jim Sanford set his sights on the Cac' and delivered some of first and hardest sport routes in Canada with enduring classics such as Permanent Waves, Young Blood and Archives. A few new routes trickled in over the subsequent years but it was the 2005 first ascent of Dreamcatcher by Chris Sharma that catapulted the obscure uber-block into the collective consciousness of the climbing world when featured in an inspiring Sender Films debut. The climbing here endures with generally excellent conditions under the forest canopy, a short approach, and an inspiring setting.",

The route features mostly gear climbing, with a few bolts on some pitches, two bolt ladders (or free at 12+) and entirely bolted belays (except one which is a tree).  Pro is plentiful and bomber.   The route has excellent pro, a wide variety of climbing (from finger-to-hand cracks, a short wide crack, a slab traverse, etc), some wild positions and a cool finish.   It is possible to rappel the route from P12 down.  From the top of P2, one can rap 30m to a station, and from there 25m to the ground.   P1:  Climb a v-slot or arete to right of V slot.  Then either straight up (10d bolts and gear) or up and slightly right (11b gear) to a bolt and right to belay.   P2:  Up and right to a flake-crack, up and right, then down and right past bolts.  5.9   P3: MONEY!  Awesome 30m of fingers to hands.  5.11b bomber gear   P4:  MONEY!  Hands to fists. 5.10c bomber gear.   P5:  Up the dihedral (5.12d or 5.9 A0) past bolts.   P6: Traverse 30 right past bolts on the wildly exposed Green Line ledge 5.5   P7:  MONEY!  Up and left through the leaning corner.  Often wet 5.12   P6 and P7 bypass: traverse halfway along the Green Line Ledge (5.5) then up the bolt ladder to the top of P7   P8:  Do an awkward set of moves past a few bolts, a tree and some gear placements, mantle, then up and left past bolts (5.10d).  OR head left after tree and follow a finger crack and other moves up to station (5.11a)   P9:  Up the nice corner 5.9   P10:  Scramble up and right past bolts and brush 5.5   P11:  MONEY!  Up the widening corner past a few bolts.  An 11+ variation heads right about 10m up  5.10d   P12:  Go to blocks on right side of ledge, then up past bolts and gear. 5.10a   P13:  Straight up to under roof, then left past bolts to a short crack.  Belay on tree.  5.10b   Walk left about 30 m on forested ledge.   P14:  Follow a blocky right-trending crack to harder moves off bolts past a short roof.  5.10d   P15:  MONEY!  Up the yellwo flake, then undercling in a cool position into the base of the massive V-slot 5.8   P16:  MONEY MONEY!  Up the 5.3 offwidth for 10m past one bolt, then stem and jam the awesome steepening V-slot hand and fist crack to a ledge.  Move up and slightly left past ledge to station. 5.10c or feels harder if you didn't bring enough water   P17:  Step to right side of ledge, and wander up for two pitches on either slabs with occasional bolts, trees and gear, OR head up and slightly left through a gnarly ugly 4th class bypass to top of 2nd summit.

Steep and pumpy liebacking brings you to a belay stance after 15m and a 2 bolt anchor.  At the end of the pitch you can either fire in a hard to place piece or punch it for the chains.  Good whipper spectating can be had on the end of this one!   p2. 12c 3 bolts, lots of small gear/nuts.  Some steep and funky climbing past a few bolts and dike rock leads to a tips corner.

                "description": "This route is a recent project that has generated a lot of online (and likely offline) debate in the last couple years. The goal was to clean a line that beginners could climb that basically tops out on the chief. It actually ends at Bellygood Ledge, and I think the easiest finish to summit the first peak would be 4 pitches on the Upper Black Dyke at a sportingly bolt protected 5.10b rating.   I found it enjoyable, and fairly 'adventurous' for  mostly 5.7 climbing. There are some loose flakes and blocks on the route and gear placements are not always simple. All of the pitches are 100 feet long or longer.   Pitch 1 - 5.7 Start about 100 yards to the right of the Black Dyke, up a blocky chimney/corner crack system that is packed tight with table sized flakes.  There is a spacious belay ledge. Gear belay.   Pitch 2 - 5.8 Head up a pretty nice hand crack right off the belay ledge, probably the crux of the climb and quite nice for about 30ft. Follow ledges and cracks to a belay at a large fir tree.  Pitch 3 - 5.7 Finger crack crux near the top.   Pitch 4 - 5.5 Climb up a tree to the top of a large flake. Traverse right and climb up into a chimney with terrible protection and brittle nasty feeling rock. Gigantic Bolted belay. This is apparently the start of a rap line to use during falcon closures and can be rapped with a single 60m rope.  Pitch 5 - 5.6 Mostly easy climbing.  Pitch 6 - 5.7, A0 Starts with a nine bolt ladder to reach a hand/fist crack. Belay below the chimney. (Apparently there is a free variation that goes to the left of the belay station up a protectable chimney corner then traverses back right into the start of the hand crack. I am not sure what the grade goes at but I'd guess no harder 5.10-?)  Pitch 7 - 5.6 Fun series of chimneys to the top.",

A good mix of sport and trad climbing, with difficulties similar to those of the Grand Wall, except more 5.10+ climbing, tending towards the technical, with less strenuous laybacking. The shady nature of this route makes it a good hot-day choice.   P1) Follow dirty treed ramps up and right to move into a clean 5.8 chimney from it's bottom left side.   P2) Up thin left-facing corners and cracks, moving right to the belay. 5.10d   P3) Up the splitter crack (finger and ring locks) then left on delicate face holds, and into another  thin crack which leads to a solitary bolt and a few hard face moves on the arete. 5.10d   P4) Sustained and technical arete climbing on all bolts. 5.11a   P5) Clean and fun chimney, with many opportunities for small gear. At ~5m up, step left out of the chimney and into a corner for a short stretch. 5.8   P6) Tricky moves around to the left quickly lead to a loose, blocky groove and easy climbing. 5.9   P7) Walk left on Trichome Ledge to the end, and begin with a technical crux sequence and mantle onto a horizontal footrail. Tiptoe across to the left, then follow great flakes and cracks up to belay. 5.10d   P8) Follow the steep corner crack to its end, at the trunk of the magical tree. From the tree, move up and then directly right to belay. This is a very good  pitch, and likely the most strenuous of the route. It demands jamming in a variety of sizes. 5.10d   P9)From the right side of the belay ledge, follow the scenic arete for 30m, passing 3 bolts. Flakes and cracks are available for protection as well. 5.9   P10) Layback up the clean finger crack, then face climb to the base of the chimney. Getting in the chimney is not recommended. The moves between the two bolts can be protected with a blue alien out to the right side. The top of this pitch seemed hard for the grade. Ends at Bellygood Ledge (possible walkoff to the right). 5.10b   P11) Traverse left 30m from the last pitch, and find belay bolts near a fir tree. This pitch features 25m of high-quality face climbing on interesting holds. with only 4 bolts, it doesn't feel like a \"sport pitch\" but most difficult moves have bolts nearby. 5.10a   P12) Devious moves off the belay (I started way out right) lead up to several bolts and into a left-trending flake and crack system. Eventually step right around a small roof, and back left to the belay. 5.10c   P13) Follow the left of two bolted lines. Along a dike and past a small roof for 35m on all bolts. 5.11a   P14) Up left on easy dyke holds, and then back right again with increasing difficulty. Fully bolted. This is known as the \"Gold Medal Ribbon\". 5.11a/b   Note: An alternative P13 and P14 are just to the right. A bolted arching corner leading to a long rightward step-across. 5.10b - Move belay to far right edge of ledge - Up the long sustained finger crack.

More 5.11 slab climbing goes straight up past 5(?) more bolts to an anchor. (Or take the 5.10 A0 variation which I haven\u2019t done: continue straight up the corner and belay at\u00a0a lower anchor, then aid on a couple bolts to the ledge and move left to the bolted anchor). Single rack and lots of draws was fine for the 11+ variation.P2: Step left around the ar\u00eate and enjoy the beautiful 5.10 corner above (fingers). Either continue up and right through trees to a big ledge and belay on hand-sized gear or a tree, or belay at the lower bolted anchor and then\u00a0move the belay up through the trees. (There are fixed lines from this anchor to the ledge but idk their age, use with discretion).P3: Head up the slab past a couple bolts. Dance like the slab/crack ballerina that you are, plugging some tiny gear along the way (5.10+). If you don\u2019t eat 5.12 corners for breakfast, be benevolent to whoever will be belaying the crux and pull up the belay seat that\u2019s stashed at the ledge below.P4: this is what you came for!

An awesome pitch.Pitch 6: The Ocean of Crisis 12d, 40m (small nuts and cams to #.75) Clip a bolt then rage up the corner placing small gear until it is possible to wildly traverse left to the exposed ar\u00eate. From here one last heartbreaker crux guards the easier blocky scramble to the chains.Pitch 7: Sports Illustrated 11d, 30m (sport) Excellent technical face climbing through the blobs.\u00a0Pitch 8: 10d, 30m (single rack) Continue up the ar\u00eate then traverse left into Clean Corner, be wary of some loose chockstones in the chimney. Or, go straight up the incredible unclimbed 5.14(?) fridge-hugging prow, bring some bolts for this variation.Descent: Rappel from anywhere on the route with an 80m rope and some shenanigans, or walk off.History: In 1990 Perry Beckham and Bill Noble rappelled in and established Sports Illustrated, as a wild hanging single pitch. The corner was first aid-climbed by Matt Maddaloni around 2000. Then around 2015 Luke Neufeld and friends put considerable effort toward cleaning, bolting and climbing the first 5 pitches.

That year was cut short by rainfall and then book ended with Covid border closures the following spring and subsequent year.The summer of 2022 I started working on the route in a different place in life. Recently married and off of the success of a new free route on Mount Hooker, I felt fit enough in both body and mind to try and complete the corner project in the Dihedrals. In mid-August I rapped in and started re-cleaning the dirty cracks and chalking the right combinations of palms and bridges on the crux corner. Without chalk on the holds I was dumbfounded on the difficulty and perplexed that I was able to one hang the route twice in 2019. On September 13th, 2022 I was able to climb the route with two falls, one on Bombay Saphire (5.11d slab) and one on the steep 5.12cish pitch above the crux corner, both of which I lowered and red pointed second try making for a free ascent to the top of the Martini Pinnacle shared with Gin and Juice, Heavy Fuel, and Stone Free.St\u00e9lmexw has marked a significant chapter in my life and is the only name that I can think of that holds the power and meaning of what this process has meant to me to . If you like really really difficult corner climbing I think you will really enjoy this climb. \u00a0As for the grade, I honestly don't know and will leave it to the community to rate this climb. \u00a0 I do believe that this route in particular is terribly difficult to grade though. \u00a0No moves ever felt that hard to me, but combining the entire pitch without falling is a very difficult task and the grade should resemble that accomplishment. \u00a0I felt I could one hang the crux corner a hundred times before sending it which made it very frustrating and hard to work on as I would go through the skin in my palms on ever effort that I tried to lead it. \u00a0 \u00a0It seemed like every move was about as difficult as the crux of The Shadow but it has been a while since climbing that route. \u00a0Maybe it is 13-, maybe it is 14-, I have no clue, but getting to the top of that corner without falling is surely one of the hardest single pitches I have climbed in my life.",

With the exception of Crap Crags, this is the easiest free route to breach the West Face of the Chief. That said, it is very sustained at 5.10, harder than Angels Crest but easier than the Grand.Sunset Strip utilizes sections of other climbs, Sticky Fingers, Millennium Falcon, Crap Crags, and The Gauntlet, with about 70% new terrain to create a very direct and interesting line up the Chief.The route has 12 pitches, several pitches can be linked and it is likely that many teams will repeat the route in 9 or 10 pitches. That said, the shorter pitches take advantage of good belay stances, decrease rope drag, and will reduce the size of rack required. The route is very well protected with several bolts added to the previously bold upper sections of The Gauntlet.

                "description": "A fantastic route that is just left of the uber-classic route, Freeway. The fourth pitch (\"Crackis Smackis\") is one of the best finger cracks in town! A photo of Jesse Huey leading this pitch is on the cover of the 2012 edition of the Squamish Select guidebook.   With the exception of P7, all pitches end with beefy bolted anchors and rap rings.   The route begins in the left-facing corner system just left of Freeway.   P1: Start up the huge arching ramp, which eventually steepens and turns into a vertical left facing corner.  This ramp can be dirty and it collects pine needles after a rain. Gear is also sparse, but not too bad. There are three bolts you can clip, but I personally find the path of least resistance skips the first one. I\u0092ve also seen it climbed skipping all the bolts and climbing the features further to the right. 5.10 (30m)   P2: Continue up the corner and make some committing moves well above a bolt to a stem corner/groove. The moves after this bolt before you can get solid gear are exciting, but safe. The gear before the crux stem corner/groove is good. Make some true stem moves to some great holds on the left. Take a breather and continue up the short left-facing corner to the anchor. 5.11- (30m)   P3:  Follow the bolts up into the cracks, which is when the climbing eases into hero climbing. Follow the cracks to the anchor. 5.11- (35m)   P4: (\u0093Crackis Smakis\u0094) This is what you came for! Climb up and right past two bolts and enter the thin-finger crack. The hardest moves are earlier, so hang in there because it gets easier as you get higher. Look for features to use outside the crack to aid you in linking the reachy finger locks. The gear is solid, but can be finicky and strenuous to place.  After ~ 10m you get a pretty good rest; place a couple pieces of gear (small) and make the final cruxy moves to better holds above. Follow the splitter and hero finger crack for ~ 15m to the anchor, which has a few rests along the way. 5.12- (30m)   P5:  The crux pitch. This pitch is entirely bolted (~ 10 bolts I think?).  Follow the bolts up and left and then back right again. The moves between the first and second bolt are 5.11+ and a fall here could result in a fall right onto your belayer; be careful and attentive! (Edit: You can apparently get in a solid green alien between the first and second bolts to mitigate this risk) After the second bolt, there are bolts more-or-less in your face for the cruxy moves. The crux of this pitch are the final moves pulling over the little roof.   P6: Climb up past three bolts before entering the left-facing and left-leaning corner. His corner eats up gear and generally the gear widens from small to large as you progress. There are no cruxy moves in the corner, but rather it is a pitch of endurance. Although there are several restful positions en route. The final moves involve you making some committing and exciting moves out of the corner to the right. Be careful not to the follow the corner too far. Most parties rappel the route from here, but the next two pitches are well worth the effort.   P7: Climb straight up, passing one bolt. Once you reach the small ledge, traverse left and clip two more bolts as you make your way to the right-facing corner. The final moves before the corner require to down climb a bit on slabby feet and poor holds for your hands. Once in the corner, climb straight up and belay at the tree. This anchor is gear and as of June 2015 there is one bolt you can also use. This bolt has no hanger though, but it does have a washer and nut.   P8: Climb straight up the left-trending groove with a hand crack in the back. Towards the end of this groove are two ancient bolts (perhaps an old anchor?). Just past these bolts is a short splitter fist crack. Climb this to its end and get an OK rest before making some strenuous traversing moves left with poor feet. The traverse is ~ three metres and ends at a splitter hand crack. Take this splitter hand crack for a few more metres to the anchors.",

                "description": "A good route that got slightly misnamed. It's a little bit of everything, true, but not the Ultimate of anything. One of the great things about the route is that you do a little of everything, which is also one of its weaknesses. You do quite a bit of low angle scrambling, forest walking, dirt avoiding, moving of belays  and low angle rock.  If you don't let that bug you, it is a great amount of good climbing besides, about 1000 of the 1300 feet is worthy, incluing thin face, slabs, traverses, cracks, etc... and if you add on the 500' you climbed just to get to the area, it is a wonderful outing, though I can't compare it to the Grand Wall, or at least not favorably.   P1 (5.9, 50m, bolted + gear): From the belay bolt, step left then up onto the rock passing a few bolts on somewhat mellow moves before moving right to bear-hug a buttress from both sides. Climb right of the bolt line for a move or two, then back left and onto easier territory again, and up into a low angle crack and groove, now placing gear. (5.6?). After 50 meters or perhaps a little less, you will come to a ledge with a bolted belay.  P2 (5.7, 40m, gear): Continue up and left on less distinct but easy, low-angle rock. You will arrive on a ledge with a bolted belay in just under 40 meters.  Belay here or move the belay left onto the next pitch (possible heavy drag).  If you belayed at the bolts atop P2, move the belay left 40 feet on the ledge, preferably up onto a pedestal at the first bolt on P3. The climbing is only 5.5 or so, and the stance is very good.  P3: (5.9++, 35M, bolts + gear)  From the first bolt atop the pedestal,  climb up and left past a second bolt on moderate moves (5.7) and to a slick and polished area with small edges for feet. This is the technical crux of the route in my opinion, though it is given only 5.9 in the books.  Moving out left to reach a blunt arete is difficult, but reasonably well protected. From there, head up and right past a few more bolts and onto a good ledge with a tree belay.  P4 (5.6, 40m, gear + bolt): Leave the belay, heading for a single bolt up and right. Clip this and head up, then up and right into a large left-facing corner with a low angle slab on its left side.  The climbing here is pretty easy and feels like low angle slab, but the crack in the corner offers some pretty frequent protection. use long slings to avoid drag. You will arrive an a heavily forested ledge from which to belay from trees.  Move the belay up perhaps 100 feet up and left through the woods on a clear trail to the base of the next cliff section. You will see a OW crack to the left and a 45' handcrack to the right. The handcrack is the next pitch, so belay there.  P5 (5.8, 20m, gear): This is the shortest pitch on the climb. Get up and into a very short section of right-facing crack for a few moves, then move right into a hand-sized offset that is left-facing for a few more meters. Set a good directional up top, and consider slinging an exposed root for a further directional, as you will top out on a ledge and move the belay far left, perhaps 30' or so past some sharp and catch flakes.  Protect your partner from a stuck rope or swing!  Move left to the first of 2 two-bolt belays. This one will have a Chain and ring anchor. Further left, perhaps 40' more there is a 2-bolt 2 ring fixe anchor that is NOT on route (??? what is it ???).  Stop and belay.  P6 (5.9-, 45M, gear + bolts): looking up you will see a left-pointing thick flake that starts as a roof, goes to a lieback, and turns to a ledge all within a few meters. Head up under this, place a piece on a long sling, start turning its corner to the left and place more gear, make a single secure 5.9 move and step up onto the flake and place more gear on a  long sling again.  Head up and left onto very low angle rock past 2 more bolts on a very pleasant slab. The feet and palms are  simply pasted down to walk up this to a slight \"roof\" of sorts. Clip a bolt over the small step of a roof and do the \"5.9+\" move (felt 5.8) to get onto the slightly more vertical section of wall, the up and right to a crack (gear with long slings) the back left on a ledge and up again to a good crack/flake leading up and right to the next ledge. Any gear placed after the last bolt will be best clipped with a sling to avoid drag.  Arrive at a 2 bolt belay on a good ledge.  I skipped this belay and continued without clipping it into the next pitch to combine pitches pitches 6-10 (5 pitches) into 3 pitches, 2 of which were 68 meters long.  P7 (5.7, 45M, sparse bolts) head up and right into an obvious dike of greyish white rock with good incuts and cobbles. Climb up this past 2 bolts (5.4?) and head left with it when it takes a 90 degree bend in that direction. Pass 2 more bolts and a 5.7 crux (balancy) between those bolts heading down and left towards a ledge with 2 small pines, each the size of your leg. If you skipped the last belay, you can belay here, using both trees slung as near to the bases as at the bases since the roots appear to be shallow. This does appear to be the original belay for the route, before some anchors were later installed, according to the McLane book, and you will be at 68 meters from the previous belay used. If however, you are pitching it out, head left on this ledge and up a second, thinner dike  to a second ledge (40' 5.3) with a 2-bolt anchor and belay there.  P8 (5.9-, 25m, bolts + gear) Climb up the thin inclusions (easy climbing) to intercept a wider dike again, passing 4 bolts with a crux near one of them. This is probably 5.9- or easier then up and right past a short easy crack/flake move to a ledge. If you are combining pitches, you will continue on the next pitch to the next ledge to run a 68 meter pitch and stop at a mid-pitch ledge on that one too.  Again, this combination of pitches as described will turn the top half into 3 pitches total, all on good ledges.  P9 (5.6, 40m, 1 gear (or not) + 1 bolt): Continue up and right on easy territory to a second ledge. If combing pitches and you cane from the 2 trees ledge, stop here for a final pitch after. If you are pitching this out into 10 as per the latest book, continue up, then up and right, heading for a shallow ledge with a 2-bolt belay that you can see far right under the roof above that contains the final pitches. If desired, head up and then up and right, passing a single bolt by a 5.6 move to reach the 2-bolt belay...  Well, regardless, with a 60M rope, you can make the final bit from the trees on the ledge mid-pitch, and I think the belay is a bit out of the way regardless and would skip it.  P10 (5.10-, 40-60m, bolts + gear) From where ever you belayed, look up, then up and left.  Start from the 2 bolt belay and head up and left on a ramp and crack (small narrow cams can be tricky) and head up into the crack below the huge roof above.  If you belayed from eh large ledge with trees, clip the bolt on P9 with a long sling and never go right to the belay, head directly up and left into the roof, noting another bolt you are headed for.  Place a .75 or 1\" cam, then a 1.25 cam which may be a little less than perfect, but add up to good pro, then stand up tall on an insecure stance to clip the bolt. Pull a few reachy moves (hard if below 5'8\" I suspect) and get into a horizontal under the roof. Head left out under this for perhaps a 40 foot span, placing some 1-2.5\" cams into blocky slots and cracks on the way, This is a real calf-burner and needs to be dispensed with quickly to avoid pumping out on the hand on the clings, or the feet on the crystals you smear on.  Turn out left beyond the roof and onto the summit none-too-soon. The huge rock up and slight left is loose and balanced in dirt. It moves if you step on it and I would not trust it for a sling-belay, so arrange an anchor on a nearby tree.    To descend, move up and right to join the summit trail downward, which will take ~ 1 hour.",
                "location": "Approach from the top of an Apron climb such as Rock On or any other, as if approaching for the Squamish Buttress, but take a left-hand branch in the trail, crossing down and over through the South Gully to a good ledge along fixed lines, when it gets sketchy.  Pass under a series of progressively lower and larger roofs, keeping an eye on the wall on your right for a lone, shiny belay bolt at the start of the route.",
                "protection": "A single set of nuts, a set of cams from .3 to 3\" and extras in 1.5-2.5\" if desired.  This rack sufficed for us despite running pitches together.  You will want a lot of 2' slings if you are used to just carrying draws.  Bolts and gear are not necessarily closely placed, but are generally available at the harder moves, with the possible exception of on the final pitch (10b variation) if you are too short to get the clip from the good holds.  I should note that there is a PG13 section  on that last pitch unless you have narrow cams that fit into the crack. I found BD cams too wide to be confidence inspiring (purple and grey) so take TCU's aliens or whatever else has a narrower profile for pieces below 1.5\"",

An excellent route in its own right, it also provides a great, all-free way to access the Grand Wall.  Expect amazing, consistent pitches of technical face climbing at the 5.10 level, good mixed pro, and immaculate rock.  Enough can't be said about this awesome climb.   P1: Begin at the base of the Chief in the corner just right of Apron Strings.  Ascend the corner (The Flake) via stemming and chimneying to a belay high up in the corner at a stance.  5.10b.  Alternatively, climb the first pitch of Apron Strings (10b), a higher quality pitch up the face to the left of the corner to the same belay.   P2: Continue up the corner briefly before traversing right out onto the face and up a steep, bolted crux section. There is a long runout on this pitch on easy climbing. Continue on to a belay.  5.10d R.   P3: Traverse almost straight right for half a ropelength to the base of a right-facing, right-leaning corner system.  The final moves around and into this corner are difficult for the grade (the key to keeping it 10b is to step down at the final bolt without being greedy and trying to clip it - once at the anchor reach back and clip it to protect your second), but the pitch is reasonably well-protected for both the leader and second.  5.10b.     P4: Ascend the sustained leaning corner to a point where one can exit out right and up to a belay at a stance. Sensibly linked into the next pitch.  5.10c.   P5: A committing move leads to a good ledge with a pin and bolt. From here continue up past a second bolt at 5.10+ (tough) and then left or from the first bolt head hard left and then up at 5.9.  Both are somewhat run out in places.  An excellent pitch. R.   P6: The final pitch climbs up and right via a very thin crescent-like corner.  Eventually the route trends almost straight back left to the ledge at the base of the Split Pillar.  This pitch is entirely bolted and well-protected.  5.10d (easier if you're tall).   Rap with two ropes or continue on.   Along with Fiddler on the Roof in Red Rocks, Nevada, Birds of Fire in Rocky Mountain National Park, and Stoner's Highway in Yosemite, Cruel Shoes rounds out a quartet of absolutely classic North American multipitch face climbs all checking in at around 5.10+.",

The first ascent was a 40 day epic, beautifully documented in the film \"In the Shadow of the Chief\" available from  fringefilmworks.com/   It was finally freed at 5.13b in 2000 by Scott Cosgrove and Annie Overlin using a number of variations.   You can get to the base of the Split Pillar by one of the routes listed in the Area description. Merci Me is described here:   P1: From Flake Ledge climb the first pitch of Merci Me (5.7) past three bolts. The first is probably 30 or more feet out.   P2: Merci Me continues up and slightly left into trickier terrain (5.8).  Break right near the second bolt and go past a detached flake and then to a two bolt belay right where the wall becomes vertical.   P3: Traverse right and slightly down, around the bulge (out of sight from your belayer) and into the 10b rising traverse.  This traverse has good pro, but the feet are poor making it strenuous.  Aid or boulder (5.12-) past three bolts to the base of the Split Pillar.   P4: The Split Pillar is a highly photogenic crack comparable to an Indian Creek splitter.  It's 10b to jam, but you would need the endurance of a 5.12 climber to layback it.  The crack widens relentlessly from rattly fingers to wide fists over about 100ft.  30 more feet include some fun flake and squeeze chimney moves.  The belay on top of the pillar is second to none.   P5-6: The Sword is the technical crux of the route with an 11a crux early on.  Place a few good pieces before committing to it.  Pull out left onto the face above the crux and savour the exposure that might seem to have crept up on you.  Easier climbing through a broken crack eventually forces you back into the dihedral on the right for a technical endurance finish to keep you honest.  The belay here is in a spectacular position, but it's hanging and can be avoided by linking the bolt ladder above.  Slings can serve as etriers for the 8 or 9 bolts in the ladder.   P7: Perry's Layback is a fully bolted, lower angle pitch, which makes it sound like a walk, but many people debate whether it's the crux of route rather than The Sword.  Climb efficiently...   P8: The Flats: Several variations are possible here.  The easiest, at 10a, goes right along a ledge until bolts lead up a slab to a ledge.  A very reachy pull takes you to the belay ledge.   P9: The final pitch is a very honest 10c requiring some tree climbing and then underclinging horizontally to the right around a big flake (The Sail Flake).  Once the flake heads up and back left you're pretty much there.   The climb can continue via the Roman Chimneys route, but most traverse off via Bellygood Ledge, a well-named 300 foot traverse to the right.  Stay roped up.   Descent: After traversing Bellygood, continue heading right into the forest.  The trail should take you to a slab that you can descend hugging the vertical wall.  A knotted rope will eventually take you to the well traveled backside trail which will take you to the climbers campground and finally the parking lot.",
                "location": "The route \"really\" starts with the Split Pillar (approaches described in the Grand Wall Area description), but since Merci Me is the minimum mandatory climbing to get to the start, this description assumes you've scrambled up to Flake Ledge (the shortest variation).",
                "protection": "Merci Me is runout bolts (up to 5.8) with some small to medium cams and nuts possible near the end.   The 10b traverse to the Split Pillar takes singles of small (finger size) to medium cams and nuts.   The bolt ladders are manageable with improvised etriers and spare 'biners or draws.   The Split Pillar is the gear hog on the route.  A double set of cams from off-fingers to wide fists is normal.  More if you're going to dog (and you will if you layback), less if you're solid jamming from tight hands to big fists.  Save a 1.5 inch piece for the last 15 feet.  The final squeeze chimney isn't easily protectable, but hey, it's a squeeze chimney.   The Sword pitch takes mostly smaller nuts and cams up to tight hands.  There are a few opportunities for slung horns and a 2 inch cam is optional.   Perry Layback is closely bolted.   The 10a pitch in The Flats is bolted but a small nut and a hand-size cam are handy.   The final pitch takes finger to hand size cams.   A few quick draws and cams are handy on the traverse off Bellygood Ledge.",

Amazing and exposed positions, great protection (on the cruxes), what more could you ask for?p1.

Move into the left facing corner and deal with the usual wetness. Even in the driest, most drought stricken summers, I have NEVER seen this pitch dry. Pull a wet lock or two and make your way to the base of the evil overhanging slot. Grovel your way to the chains.p2. 12-, 70'. Big fingers in the corner leads to an undercling out left. Going straight up is the Shadow, maybe the best pitch in Squamish? (12d+). Get creative and grovel to the chains.p3. 11+ 40'. If you hit everything right I guess its only 11+, BUT on the OS, expect it to feel harder. Fingers in a wide chimney/slot over a roof to a great ledge.p4. 5.11-, 100'. Great fingers in a corner, either go left on some under clings or straight up to a roof and underclings, a few fixed pins.

Finesse your way up to some horizontal breaks then go straight left on the finger tip traverse with no gear. Don't fall, then get some gear in and climb the amazingly thin and hollow flake - I am 190lbs and it has held me a half a dozen times so pull away!

Pull a hard slab/mantel move off the belay, go to the head wall and traverse left to the new free bolt. Clip it and balance your way up the wall to grab the ledge.

For us, it was pretty dirty with a decent amount of loose rock, vegetation and required gardening on lead. All in all, I don't really recommend the route... or at least, do the top 25 first and come over here if you're really itching for something new.   P1 (5.10-): Go straight left on the ledge about 25 feet to the tight dihedral with a continuous crack. Beware the long, skinny flake in the corner at the start, it is not really in there (but you use it anyways). Continue straight up and maybe slightly right through the left end of the roof bands on some ok gear then up a little more to a bolted anchor. (Note: about half way up the pitch, there is a flake that is easy to traverse out left to a ledge. I went over there and it was all mossy and seemed off route).   P2 (5.11b): The money pitch. Climb seams past 4 or 5 fixed pins to a series of three stacked flakes in the corner that you can either jam or lieback. The seam was rather dirty and grassy so you might want to have your nut tool ready to clean on lead. Finish at a bolted anchor. Recommend to keep going and link to the next anchor as it would be an uncomfortable belay.   P3 (5.10-): Continue up and right to another bolted belay on a ledge at the base of the main dihedral #3 or #4 to back up since bolts are rusty).   P4 (5.10): The dihedral pitch. Start out on a 15\u0092 section of wide crack. A #4 might fit but we didn\u0092t take one. You can place a #3 deeper in one spot or just punch it to the ledge that starts the main dihedral. Climb this left leaning to right leaning dihedral past bushes and loose chockstones. Be prepared to clean on lead and be careful not to dislodge the loose blocks. Topo shows bolt or FP for traverse left at the end but I didn\u0092t see anything. Grey or yellow alien protects the traverse well. End at bolted belay.   (From here, the old 2001 McClane book shows the last two pitches as mid 5.10 but I had a different experience, which I will write up here since I spent plenty of time unsuccessfully looking for the documented line).   P5 (10+ / 11-): Go up and left around the corner from the belay. Punch it through dirty, loose stuff. Place a couple marginal pieces. Pull a hard move to claw some dirt until you can grab the tree root (if you're tall you might not have to jump to it). Yard on this and tie it off, continuing to a really chossy ledge.  I got lost here but I really think you just want to go straight left at this ledge because there is a three bolt anchor over there. I tried to go up and right (as topo indicated) and ended up on a poorly protected slab which I tried to start 4 times before backing off. Then I tried going far right on the ledge, which went nowhere, then finally back left and found that anchor. Book says bold 10c. I\u0092d say harder than that, chossy and a potentially bad fall on the hard move.   P6 (5.11- PG13):  Looking up and slightly right from the bolted belay you will see 2 right angling hand cracks (slung horn with fixed biner on top) and a right angling flake just right of these. Choose one (I took the left crack) and climb past the pinnacle, clipping the fixed sling up and left into a dihedral. I thought this dihedral was full-on. Not great gear and really thin, I ended up aiding it using four micro brass offset nuts in little crystals (including the tiny black one) and it still felt sketch. Climb (or aid) this dihedral then pull some thin flake/sport moves up and right to reach the far left end of the dance platform behind some massive boulders. Use the rope to extend the anchor all the way back to a tree (or further to a bolted anchor) and a #1 & #2 behind a chocktone up there and then just use the fixed cordalette as a directional.    To get off, traverse right behind the huge boulders to the bolted anchor. Walk the bellygood style ledge to 4th class that takes you up to the roman chimneys start. You can rap from this tree back down to the the far left side of bellygood and escape, or link into upper black dyke or some other route.",

Moving to Montana is very similar in style and quality to Cruel Shoes, just a little harder and a bit more heady.   This climb has been retro-scrubbed and its rusty 1/4\" bolts were replaced in an excellent gesture of public service.   p1 (11a): Originally graded 10d, I think this pitch should be bumped up as the recent cleaning removed a stump that provided a key rest/foothold.  Some easy climbing gets you to a bolt, but the the next 15' are hard and a bit scary.  You then get a great rest before a section of sustained tips laybacking/smearing.   p2 (10a): I've seen this pitch rated 5.9 and 10b but I think 10a is reasonable.  From the belay climb some easy cracks to an overlap before boldly breaking out left onto the slab where a bolt will get you to the belay.   p3 (10c):  Tricky face climbing past 2 bolts leads to a 'memorable mantle' that must be executed before you get the 3rd bolt.  The runout is about 20' and the mantle move is probably about 5.8 or 9.  Move left into a nice crack and under-cling it as it arches right past another couple of bolts.  A long and excellent pitch.   p4 (11a):  The Money.  Step down from the belay and traverse right along an under-cling with good pro.  Climb up on the hanging slab at the obvious opportunity and move up easily to clip a bolt.  Weave a devious line up and down across the slab past 3 more bolts, sustained all the way to the anchor.",

Perform an easy but sloping top out to finish.Good luck, and don\u2019t miss the pads.Just above\u00a0the lip there are bolted anchors for top roping (bring a tarp to protect your anchor from the lip of the boulder) and 10m up the slab of the boulder there is a large tree to rig another line down (as of August 2023 there is a decent condition 11mm dynamic rope rigged for solo top roping the upper moves, the rope is too thick to use an ascender on)The best method for working this boulder is to bring a normal size rope and descend the large line attached to the tree in order to rig a top rope from the bolted anchors so you can jug or ascend it as necessary.Working the moves on and to the left of the sloper rail is extremely challenging due to the overhang of the boulder and the fact that the holds are far left of the anchor. You will likely need a partner to pull you in if you are just on the rope with a grigri or will have to have someone belay a full top rope set up so you can safely try the moves from the ground without pads.Beta video (Front angle): https://youtu.be/dWc6hd3zgDY?si=orQwPyBXVpDfMxhcBeta video (Side angle):  youtu.be/5b1CA7qoWE8?si=5p_\u2026",

Astrologger is on good rock and is an attractive line, but the necessary difficulty in getting to it and its lonely position mean that it is seldom traveled. If you could climb the top alone, or the route had been cleaner, I would have given this 3 or 4 stars.    As well, its given grade of 11b is way out of line with other local grades and is sandbagged sufficiently so as to be hard on the Ego.   To avoid an awkward scramble, we elected to lead up the \"approach pitch\" past the anchors and combine this into a single pitch. The opening is A0, french-freeing a fixed line to the first of several bolts, then 5.10 climbing up on good but dirty holds (I cleaned these, but rain might restore their dirty condition), to an anchor. The climbing is sufficient to assure that you will not arrive to the anchor at 'the base' in fresh condition, and the climbing right off this anchor starts off tough and gets tougher.  From the anchor get up a leaning, overhanging flake, (1.5\" gear) get into the corner (2\" gear) and then fight your way up the corner on slick thin jams (2-2.5\" gear) with an occasional wide piece. The crux comes about 1/3 the way up the main pitch, but the rest is still exhausting.  At the top the climbing relaxes back to 5.10 after a few good jams (3\") and is a thinner crack (fingerlocks) to reach a serviceable bolt-and-chain anchor.",

Turn left and follow the light path (I dare not call it a trail) to the rock and keep and eye up on the wall at eye level for a fixed and knotted line with bolts above, and the bolt line to the anchor below the steep left-facing acute dihedral/flake.",

Mostly bolted and past fixed pins/wires, plus a small piece or two to a two bolt anchor (hanging belay).   P2 (11d/12a): New books upgraded this pitch to 12a. This is the classic splitter corner on the cover of Alpinist 35. Fingers to off fingers to .75 camalot to #1 to #2s to a bolted anchor (hanging belay). If you really want the mega pitch, link P1 & 2 for full value. You could place 3x #1s on this pitch but not necessary. Alternately, the book shows that you can link this pitch into the next one in 50m. You could use 3x #1s if linking this way. You probably cannot link P1,2 &3 into the super-mega-pitch.   P3 (5.10+): If you belayed on bolts at the end of the last pitch, get back into the splitter for 30' then up into the chimney roof. If you only brought 1x #3 then bump it as you pull the roof and leave it above. You could bring a second #3 if you wanted. Don't wear a pack in the chimney. Climb to the top of the splitter and traverse on undercling fingers to a bolted belay (hanging belay).   Side note: a partial linkup variation of Alaska Highway to The Calling but ending here at the end of P3 on the Calling and rapping out is called \"Southern Lights\". This is my recommendation. This way is an absolute 5 star classic. The following pitches aren't that good and get REALLY dirty. Seemed like you could rap off with a single 70 but I'm not positive. Might want to bring two ropes if rapping. Linking AK Hwy and all of the Calling is called \"Northern Lights\".   P4 (5.12a): Sport pitch (maybe a gear placement). Right around the corner and into the dihedral (tricky start). Continue up this rather dirty corner past bolts then left up onto the face and a stance. Pull the crux (maybe 12a for a tall person but way harder for a short person, or A0). Pass a few more bolts to a bolted anchor on a super dirty slab with 6\" think moss everywhere and be perplexed as to where you should go to navigate the dirtiness on the next pitch.   P5 (5.10 moss & choss): From the belay there are two bolts. One is out right towards a cool looking crack but the slab seemed plenty harder than 5.10 and runout (and was really dirty and mossy friction climbing). I don't think the route goes this way as the book says \"rock continues to deteriorate in the bushy corner above\". Look up and slightly left of the belay. There is a bolt about 25' up hiding in the moss. You will see an old pin with tat on the vert wall above it. Go up that way (there's also two bolts next to the pin), clip, go right into the bushy corner. Climb poor quality rock up then left across a loose 4th class ramp to a ledge. Belay here on gear in kitty litter or on a tree or off an old single smc bolt.   P6 (5.10+): Another pretty dirty pitch with subpar rock takes to you the top. Start up the corner, then past the pins on the face, back to the crack, pulling the #2 roof, then right through one more roof with undercling lock. Mantle the sandy ledge. Belay off a tree.   Descent: Go straight right along the cliff edge for 5 minutes (past the big cave/chimney) until you're forced up and into a switchback. Go to the Chief summit and walk down the Chief trail.",

I think a standard double rack from green alien to #2 camalot plus a #3 camalot would be fine. You could take a third .5, #1 or #2 camlot, especially if linking the enduro corner. Also take 12 draws / shoulder slings. All anchors are beefy bolts until the last one on route and the topout.",

                "description": "Chilkoot Pass is a two-pitch variation finish to the excellent climb of The Calling. It avoids the final two pitches of the Calling, which are overgrown, uneventful and rarely climbed. This variation keeps the climbing in the sustained 5.11 range. Both pitches are varied, exciting and fun! They are full value after previously climbing to this point!   This variation begins near the end of the fourth (aka. crux) pitch of the Calling. After pulling the crux on this pitch, veer immediately right on a small ledge to a two bolt anchor. This cuts the fourth pitch of the Calling short by ~ 30 feet and avoids the run out moves on the moss minefield slab that The Calling continues up.    P1: Make easy moves and clip a bolt to the right of the anchor. Down climb a few feet on a hanging slab and make a few slab moves as you angle rightward and up. Gain a slabby crack, which leads to an obvious crack on a headwall. Climb the thin-hands crack, which narrows to fingers at the end. Pull into a slabby right-facing corner which angles rightward. Gear anchor. 5.11+   P2: This pitch works its way through the two intimidating small roofs that are obvious from the anchor immediately above. Clip two bolts as you face climb slightly right to the entrance of the first roof and, once established under the roof, hand traverse left to the obvious entrance of the first roof.  Take a quick rest with perfect hand jams and prepare to pull yourself, on great jug(s) and finger lock(s), up into a small a small alcove. Pull yourself into the alcove. Clip a bolt to the left of this alcove (to prevent rope drag) and take an optional seated rest as you admire Squamish below. Stiff and tight underlining and/or ring-locks get you through the second roof, which leads to a finger-to-hand crack in a right-facing corner. Ride this to crack to the ledge with one quick roof to battle with en route.

While all of the hardest climbing is bolted, this is not a sport climb. There are some decent runouts and heads-up moments throughout.P1. Climb the first pitch of New Life. 50m, 5.10bP2. Walk right to the end of the ledge until you can traverse right and move around a corner (crux, exposed!). Once around the corner, keep traversing on poor crimps, good underclings, and smeary feet until you can stem across the cavernous chimney and reach the belay station on the other side. The end of this pitch is pretty gripping to follow; the first ascensionists recommend clipping the first bolt of P3 to protect the second. 5.11d, about 15m.P3. What you came for. Move up and right from the belay around the corner to the face (an alpine on the first bolt will help reduce rope drag. Then get ready for what feels like an eternity of techy, sustained climbing that weaves between the face and the arete. The first crux comes about halfway up, when the angle of the face kicks back to slightly overhanging. This is followed by an easier section (5.10a-ish) of crack and face climbing which is protected with gear (you could also set up a gear belay here). The second (in my opinion, much harder) crux comes immediately after this section. BETA WARNING: it involves slapping between a lefthand vertical rail and a righthand arete until you can get a high foot and pull a delicate rockover move to clip the next bolt. After the second crux, a couple more bolts bring you to the huge belay ledge. Look up and left for the anchor. 50m, 5.12- (the first ascensionists claim 12a, but that's a bit of a sandbag)P4. The final pich follows Nanook's rappel route. Although there are some beautiful cracks and cool movement, as of writing, this pitch was dirty and overgrown, and very out-of-character with the quality of the rest of the route. If you arrive here and this is still the case, then rapping is reccommended. If you choose to continue, then head up a crack choked with sketchy, horrible treestumps until you can get in a fist sized cam. A few grunty moves past a wide section get you to some hand jams, then an alcove where you can chill out. Move up right from this along a cool, detached flake, which brings you to a horizontal, leftward finger traverse (save that black totem for this). From here, climb a tight hands to fist crack (0.75 to #1 camalots) for about 8m. Clip the anchor which is hanging in space, then mantle the ledge to the actual belay station. 5.10c, about 35m.Notes:- Apparently the rappels are real rope stretchers with a 70m. Tie knots.- The average bolt spacing is 3-4m on pitch 3. They get closer together for the first crux, and you can pull on draws to bypass some of the difficulties. For the second crux, this isn't really possible, you have to actually climb the thing.- If you bring a pack, bring a tagline to save the second on the hard pitches. The hauling is straightforward everywhere except P2; here, you can haul the pack around the corner by tying the pack off on a bight mid-rope, and having the leader haul it up while the second pays out rope.",

We did not do the lower section  below Astro ledge, so I can't speak of that, but it sounds like nobody ever did that portion.  Expect some dirty mossy lichen covered cracks, route finding and be prepared for an adventure. Less woods hiking than angels crest.  In the old McLane book it is 5.9 and 10a in the more recent one.   This route would be awesome with a clean-up.   A great place to be on a hot day, even the descent is mostly in the dark woods, unlike the top of the middle or south peaks.  It's a great up and over adventure in the shade.   General directions, but not too specific to keep it an adventure.   We approached via the first 4 pitches of parallel passages, and followed fixed ropes lines to the base   We had no description of the route, and followed the path of least resistance.   1) Off astro ledge, find the tree with the green flagging and a blocky gully near the sharp bend of the trail. Combine first 2 pitches, pass first belay, low 5th class, unless you like the look of the hand crack on the left side as I did, around the crest to the right, another chain on tree. 60 meters    2) move the belay or simulclimb 20- 30 meters left of crest, lead out  40- 50 meters up blocky flakes  to conifer in groove. 5.7/5.8  3) combine 2 pitches here for a nice long varied cracks 60 meter pitch. 5.9 . plenty of ledges if you want to break it up. toward the end of this there is a chimney with a flake on the right and an old knarly Yew tree to crawl under and mantle at the end on a dirty top out to big tree ledge with a view out west.  4) through a cleft in the rock behind 3 pine trees, avoids dropping into dirty gully on the left. Large chockstone gully.  Follow the right side crack to avoid the chockstones. laybacks to crawl under trees on ledge. 20 meters    5.9  5) move belay 30 meters left through woods with a blocky start, then easy path to 2nd chimney.Either belay at top of 5.6 chimney or continue up dirty corner, avoid brush by climbing small slot/chimney on the right, traverse blocky arete to left side and up to slopping ledge, cross log, steep layback till belay at Cedar and birch, 60 meters, 5.9  6) This is the most obvious path on the whole route because there is a piton in the corner ahead of you. finger crack runs into chimney/cave, the birthing pitch brings you out to the sunshine for the first time all day at the top of Zodiac. 10a past the piton, or pull on it with the cracks being 5.8 then.   Interesting hike up to Zodiac peak, passing the slack line to the third peak.  find another rope to pull up and fixed ropes to the top.  Good views that you don't see from the other peaks.  Find trail down rugged third peak trail.  Take a side trip up the slahany trail to view cobra crack on the way down or visit the solarium wall.",

                "description": "Teddy Bear's Picnic is the original hard route up the Prow Wall, tackling a fairly direct and ridiculously exposed line staying quite close to the actual prow feature from bottom to top. All of the pitches are very good climbing, and the two hardest are truly exceptional as they ascend aesthetic features with diverse, athletic, and difficult movement.   Note: This description begins on the tree ledge one pitch above South Gully. This pitch is described as the start of Gravity Bong/Unbearable. It is 10+/11- and often wet, making it fun in a different kind of way.   P1 (12-, 35m):  Climb the flare/chimney directly above the bolted anchor that arcs wildly left and spits you out onto bolted face climbing. Continue climbing left to a nice, flat pedestal with a bolted belay. Alternatively, you can traverse left and up along the tree ledge and climb the first pitch of Unbearable to the same pedestal.   P2 (11c, 35m): A diverse and totally awesome pitch. Climb a steep seam, past two bolts, that opens to a finger crack, then up an off-width to a stance. Clip a bolt and layback/squeeze the arete to another stance below the Elevator Shaft. Climb the Shaft; it's really fun. Belay at a ledge with two bolts.   P3 (12-, 25m): Very sustained stemming, fingers/tips jams, laybacking, and hip/shoulder scumming up the right-facing corner (the left side of the shaft). At the top of the corner swing right (Unbearable moves left) under the roof, bolt above your head, to a ledge. Jam/layback up the left-facing corner (making sure to save multiple thin fingers-size cams for this section) to some exposed moves to arrive at \"Rancho Relaxo,\" a very nice belay alcove.   P4 (12d, 28m): A mind-blowing overhanging crack. Climb straight up from the alcove, then traverse right around the corner (be gentle on the stump!) past a bolt to a stance on the exact edge of the prow below the splitter that goes on forever. Start with delicate moves on the hairline seam, then power up the steeper fingers and thin hand jams to a ledge rest. Continue up the crack as it narrows back down, eventually moving left and also using the right facing corner crack, ending at a bolted hanging belay below two lines of bolts.   P5 (13a, 15m): The Changing Corners. Layback tenuously up to the sharp arete. Channel your inner Houdini to get around it, and then power up some more very powerful laybacking and crimping that eases off as you move to another spacious ledge and anchor. This pitch is fully bolted (5 total), and it would be highly advantageous to have the draws already hung, especially a long draw/sling on bolt 3. (There is also a line of bolts directly up the round corner directly above the belay that you can use as an aid escape.)   P6 (11c or 12b, 15m): Climb easily if a bit awkwardly up the corner, clip a bolt below the roof, and do a very stretched out, tenuous move to the arete. Pull around the corner to another bolt and do the hero finish up the face to the top of the wall. The grade of this pitch depends greatly on your wingspan.   From the rim, walk up and climber's right to the 2nd Peak Trail.",

If rappelling in, hike the 2nd Peak Trail to above the ladder. Ascend about 100m more to the first very large flat rock (but still below the 2nd Peak summit).

I spotted a line to the top that looked like the easiest way up the Prow wall, thinking it would be nice to do a free route up this amazing piece of stone that wasn't 5.13!  The result is a bit easier, sharing pitches from T-Bears and Gravity Bong, with 4 new pitches of stellar crack climbing.   p1. 5.11a.  Same as Gravity Bong, originally graded 10c, but expect 11a awkward flare climbing on the bottom half.  At the top go up and right to a bolted belay shared with Teddy Bears Picnic and Gravity Bong. 35m, watch for loose rocks on ledge.   p2.  5.10c  Walk the ledge at the base of the wall left for 10m or so until you get to a 5.8 ramp with a corner crack that is a little dirty. Go up this for 15m to a stance and then get in the flake crack on the main wall until the nice ledge with a 2 bolt anchor (p. 1 of Teddy Bears joins here.) 35m.   p3.  5.11c  Same as Teddy Bears p2.  2 bolts on the tips flake/crack and some more cranking bring you to a ledge with a short wide crack.  Up this to stance, clip a bolt, and layback the arete on the left to come to a stance at the base of the amazing elevator shaft.  Stem, double cracks, jam layback up the amazing shaft to a nice ledge and 2 bolt anchor.  40m.   p4.  5.12a  Starts the same as Teddy Bears but goes up and left through the slot at the top of the shaft.  Tips laybacking and stemming in the brilliant rock gets you to a chimney stem rest.  Bust up and left in the purple camalots out the roof that goes at an easier grade than you would imagine.  Follow the feature up and left until you get to the treed ledge with with a 2 bolt anchor.  40m.   p5.  5.11, the Gentleman's Flake, harder for small hands.  At the left end of the ledge followed the flake cracks up to the stumps in the overlap flake crack, that can be jammed, laybacked or underclinged, 1 4 camalot at the start of the business and then 3 camalots out the traverse.  Pull on the tree to the 2 bolt anchor.  40m.   p6. 5.10  Lots of options, the crux is in the first ten feet. then you can either grovel up the chimney with face holds to a 2 bolt anchor (15m) or traverse left past a chopped cedar stump and face climb on cracks and ledges far left to another 2 bolt anchor by a small tree.

                "description": "This route runs along the edge of the North Gully and frames the top of the Sheriff's Badge.  There are lots of ledges and terraces, and moving the belay is quite common.   Begin on a blocky pitch of 5.8 with a pin.  Climb up to a large ledge and belay.   Climb the magnificent Angel's Crack, a diagonal hand and finger crack, at 5.10a.  Belay on a good ledge at its end.   Next, climb a difficult face, the crux, at 10b past 2 bolts and up into a corner.  There is a belay at a large slung boulder on a slab, but I thought it was more comfortable to climb another 15 feet up and belay on the ledge above.   Traverse along the ledge and up some easy slab to the base of the next wall (5.7).   Face climb up to the beginning of a left-facing corner.  Step right below this corner and enter a right-facing corner on the other side.  This can be tricky to see from below.  Climb up the corner (5.10a) and step right again below a roof.  Belay on a ledge.   Climb a pitch of 5.7 to a large ledge.  This pitch can be successfully linked with the last one to make one long pitch.   Move the belay to the base of the next wall.  Climb up a ramp, step right to a second ramp, then step right again into a corner system (5.10a).   Move the belay again.  There are two options here.  The normal way is to climb up a 5.9 lieback in a corner to another large ledge.  The second is a 5.10b 7\" offwidth crack.  This crack is pretty consistent in size, so you can't get a #5 Camalot in there, even way back (trust me on this one).  Bring your Big Bros if you wanna shot at this beast.   Follow the climber's trail up through the trees to the base of the Acrophobe's Traverse.  Climb to the top of the first tower (5.7), rap off the back side, then scramble up low 5th class rock to a fixed rope (you can see it from the top of the rappel).  Descend the fixed rope to a dirty alcove and climb up to the notch between the highest tower and the ridge (low 5th).   From the notch, climb up to a nice ledge (5.9).   You have a couple options from here.  Start at a tree (using the tree to get past the start is permissable) and climb a 5.8+ fist crack up to a blocky corner.  Continue up to the Whaleback Arete and belay at the base of the next, steep and somewhat intimidating, wall.  Otherwise, traverse right along the ledge and climb a 5.10b/c crack, joining the route at the top of the Whaleback Arete.   Begin this pitch at the large dead tree growing out of the crack.  Pull through this opening roof past a pin using the main crack and also a second crack on the left.  Continue jamming up steep ground, past several small roofs and a couple trees to the top of the wall (5.10a).  This pitch is sustained and somewhat strenuous, so make sure you have some energy left!   Step right into a 5.8 squeeze chimney, which opens up near the top.  If you are carrying a pack, bring a double-length sling to drop the pack on, you won't be able to fit in the chimney otherwise.   Congratulations!  You are at the top!  Enjoy the views from the Chief on the walk back, and then high-tail it down to the Howe Sound Brew Pub to celebrate!",

This flake isn't going to last forever, and it'll be a bad day when it falls.  Work the two parallel cracks (one is 3-5\" and the other is 1-2\") up the leaning wall until at the roof.  The cracks offer excellent jamming, but the entire face leans to the right which significantly increases the pump!  Undercling out the roof (green camalots) and pull the roof (crux) to another 10-15 feet of thin jamming.  I didn't have a green camalot available when pulling the roof and was unhappy about it.....

                "description": "Borderline is a quality climb featuring a variety of climbing and excellent protection. You get a little bit of everything on this baby, including a burly \u0096 but bolt protected - squeeze chimney.  Highly recommended.   The bad news?  You might have Madonna's song running through your head like I did...... I was even whistling it without knowing it while climbing.  Fortunately nobody was around.....   I read an interesting post on cascadeclimbers.com from the first ascent folks.  They debated the bolts on the chimney, since \u0096 in theory \u0096 it could be protected with big bros, but ultimately decided that if big bros were required, the climb wouldn\u0092t get done, and then would get grown over and forgotten to obscurity.  Because of the bolts, the route gets repeated \u0096 which keeps it clean.   The bolts were placed on lead from, apparently, sketchy big bros.   A great route that I imagine required a mighty cleaning effort to establish.    P1 (10b)  Start on the far left side of the bushy ledge at the end of the approach/scramble trail.  There are anchor bolts to belay here.  The first bolt requires a move or two to reach, but there is bomber pro at your feet.  Make some technical face moves and trend up left through cracks until you reach the obvious corner.  Continue up the corner and pull around a big tree.   Your belay bolts are here, but around the corner to the left \u0096 not visible unless you look for them.  45m. P2 (5.8) I chose the 5.8 version, but there is also an 11c version.  Head up the corner until it is possible to traverse right about 10\u0092 and gain another crack.  Up this crack, pull on the tree, and then climb through the dirt a bit.  If you continue up, you\u0092ll be on the Terrace below Blazing Saddles.  Instead, take the cracks/corner up and left past a single bolt to the anchor.  30m. P3 (10d)  Climb up the ramp and traverse left about 40\u0092 to the first bolt (some gear is available midway).   The next 4-5 bolts offer sustained mid-10 face climbing with quality, fun movement and plenty of bolts.  The bolts end at a splitter finger crack.   Charge up the finger crack for quite a ways to the anchor.  The books calls the finger crack 10d, but it felt more like 10b/c to me.  It is sustained though.  A long, varied pitch.  45m. P4 (10a) Easy climbing up the ramp ends at a fun roof.  Pull the roof and continue up about 40\u0092 to the anchor.  Above you looms the chimney\u0085. (about 25m) P5 (10a) How often do you get to arm bar and clip bolts at the same time??????  Step one, clip the bolt.  Step two, figure out how to start the chimney.  Step three, arm bar away!   Apparently you can layback the chimney, but that wouldn\u0092t be near as much fun.  Thanks to the F/A folks for placing the bolts, otherwise this climb would never get done (the squeeze chimney is about 8\" wide).  Finish the chimney and head around right up a layback crack.  We built a belay about 10\u0092 about the snag, way too much rope drag to continue. (about 30m) P6 (10d) Fun, well protected bolt clipping to the top (about 20m).",

While the upper pitches rely on bolts for protection this is not a sport route. \u00a0All of the pitches require one to execute difficult moves above your protection, sometimes with consequence. Take care on this old school endeavor.\u00a0P1 - 11a - 45m\u00a0Start up Mercy Street and after about 40 feet step left into a nice right facing corner. Follow this, 11a, until you can start working right to a belay under a small roof.P2 - 12a - 30mWork right until you reach a corner. Jam up this with increasing difficulty until you can step left to a good ledge. An excellent technical lead.\u00a0P3 - 11b - 4 Bolts - 15 m.\u00a0From the ledge clip a bolt and start climbing down a ramp passing two more bolts on the way to a large ledge. Keep going left, clipping a final bolt to protect the final moves to a good ledge. Belay at two bolts with rings.P4 - 13a - 11 bolts - 30m.\u00a0The crux pitch. Start off the left side of the ledge with 5.10-5.11 face climbing to reach a ledge. A few alpine draws will help with rope drag. Upon reaching the sloping ledge clip a high bolt and prepare for a tricky boulder with fall potential back onto the ledge. Two more bolts of climbing lead to a lefward traverse below a thin layback feature. Climb up past three bolts to a hard sequence and a good hold. Clip, and then move left across the face to reach a large horizontal crack and the anchor. Belay at chains at a semi hanging stance.P5. 12a - 5 bolts - 25 m\u00a0Traverse 15 feet to the right on a good horizontal to reach the first bolt. Execute a balance sequence to reach a second bolt and then crimp and techy your way up to a horizontal with an optional gear placement. Exciting! Work right again to reach another bolt and follow flakes with more optional gear and occasional bolts to a belay in a corner at a small ledge.(I would recommend a single set of cams to from .3 to #1 for this pitch.)P6. 11d - 9 bolts - 40mClip a bolt way out left and then work your magic to move left across the wall to reach a large rail. Follow the rail up and left, surmount multiple slabby cruxes until you are standing on yet another good rail. From here work up and then right to get established in a shallow right leaning groove. Follow this up until it ends and step right, spooky, to reach better holds and a bolt. Savor the big footholds for a moment before all the holds melt away. Work up and right past more spaced bolts as the angle slowly lowers and you find yourself squeaking your way up to the anchor. Wow. A bold pitch.You can rappel the route with an 80m rope or two ropes. Start by rapping the route to the base of P4 (the 13a crux).P6->P5 - 38m.\u00a0P5->P4 - 25mP4->P3 - 30m.\u00a0From the base of P4 (the 13a crux) you can rap straight down ~20m to an off route anchor with Metolius Rap Hangers.

Climb the obvious path through the moss and bushes past some surprisingly tricky and committing moves until you emerge from the vegetation and the wall sweeps out to your left (5.7).  You could belay here, but there's no reason not to carry on to the station for Rock Loggers rather than belaying from the forest.  There are two choices for getting there.  You can head straight up to the first bolt on Tantalus Wall and then aid left to a groove and downclimb the groove to the station.  This presents difficulties for protecting the second on the traverse and the downclimb as the groove is overgrown and slick when wet.  The other option is to immediately traverse straight out left on some bolts.  This was wet so we opted for the groove, which was also wet and unpleasant.   P2. Head up the obvious left facing crack until it arches around to become an undercling.  It apparently goes free at 11d, but is called 10c if you use the second and third bolt for aid.  After the bolts it continues to head left and the holds appear to die out just before you reach the corner.  The trick here is to downclimb about ten feet, then go left into the corner and back up to the station. (5.11d or 5.10c A0)   P3. This beautiful left facing corner has great locks, takes great pro and is one of the most sustained pitches of its grade around. (5.10b).   P4. The spectacular corner continues and is long and steep.

Good pro and 3/8\" bolts are infrequent enough to keep you on your toes the whole time.P1 (45m): climb thoughtfully off the deck into a long, left-arching rivet ladder which ends at an intermediate 2-bolt anchor. Continue past this anchor leftwards into a traversing mini roof/flake then head up the face to the anchor. C2P2 (35m): this pitch heads straight up the wall and is quite sustained. Lots of fixed heads (of varying quality), some rivets, and then fun hooking moves lead you to the anchor. A fall (while safe) might zipper a sizeable portion of the pitch, so try not to.
