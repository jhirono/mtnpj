Brought the #5 and made the committing moves. Could also place during the traverse. Didn't really need the #4. Drag at the end to get to Logger's Ledge was horrendous. There is an intermediate anchor if you want it. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Alex yelled up some crucial beta about a 0.75 right before you cut feet. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Super mellow with a #5. It\u2019s a juggg baby. Great exposure and movement \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 Follow. \u00b7 Follow. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. With Edwards \u00b7 Follow. This one is wild. Good gear. Quite a move to pull the roof. Fell. \u00b7 Follow. Gunk style roof - did not lead, but could if feeling strong \u00b7 Follow. Followed Audrey \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 Lead / Flash. The starting anchor (after climbing 80% of P1 of Catapult) is a gear anchor, gear #2-4, can use a small/medium nut and a 0.2 in a pinch. Then used 0.4-5 on actual Bone, having one #3 for the pitch itself is nice, as is a #5. Once on top the roof it\u2019s easy and 0.4-1 gear. I think I only used singles. \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Spooky loose rock on the horizonral crack beneath the roof, and the vertical crack beneath needs a #5. Otherwise suuuupser fun! \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 Follow. \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 Lead. Such a good pitch. Unbelievable exposure. \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight.

With Ryan \u00b7 Follow. w Harold. really fun route, take early exit right, keep #3 for anchor \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. \u00b7 2 pitches. Follow. w Reinder. Harder than a 5.9. I'd say 5.10. Holds were good, but quite overhanging and swinging feet on top of the \"bone\" not a 5.9 move. Pumpy. Hung/fell while trying to pull the crux (pump). Pro is good. Incredible exposure. Gear anchor at start of P1 (stoner ledge), bolts 15 feet above the bone (for us end P1). Heads-up that the follower might swing far from the wall if falling at the crux \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 Follow.

Led from ground. Lots of rope drag even with long slings. Stop at ledge next time. Then go from ledge, over bone & to the top on 2nd pitch. \u00b7 Follow. Swapped to this instead of the last part of catapult. Loved the exposure and high feet and huge hands. So much fun! w Olivia / LWGs \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Fun.

The aha moment was when i realized I had to (or rather, got to) cut feet. We set up a small anchor on top of the bone (there\u2019s barely room but it works) to bring up the second which made it a lot easier to manage falls/takes on the roof than it would have been from way up on logger\u2019s ledge. Hope you have walkie talkies\u2026 \u00b7 Follow. With FS Owen. Fell twice, I\u2019ve never heel hooked before \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Super fun, linked with the Canapult pitch which was really great but shoulda extended the last piece. Rope drag was a lot. #2 in the roof was great beta. Katie was hella spooked on the follow.

I believe castlerock to be a bit stiff. The climb was really fun and exciting, but I was definitely a little puckered in the middle section. Top crack was awesome! Used almost an entire double rack between the pitch and gear anchor. P2 was dirty and unremarkable \u00b7 Follow. With JV and Han. Jared led lower, I led upper.

Nice 5.6 laybacks. and some great hand cracks. Continue following path of least resistance, more ramps, cracks. Interesting note: the little tree in the chimney existed in 1960 says Fred Beckey.

A memorable line, Canary combines interesting climbing with terrific exposure.Approximately 100 feet to the left of Saber, a short section of face climbing leads to a right facing dihedral and a broken crack system that reaches the left side of Saber ledge. This is the start of Canary.P1. Begin by climbing approximately 15 feet of unprotected face to the base of a right facing dihedral. This section is not trivial, but the holds are positive and it is no harder than 5.7. Alternatively, it may be possible to begin in a small dihedral to the left and traverse right to gain the crack system at the top of the face. From the top of the face, follow the dihedral and subsequent crack systems up with good gear. Ascend until you are under the giant roof, then break right onto Saber ledge at the top of the crack system. This pitch is the technical crux of the climb, culminating in the moves up and onto Saber Ledge (5.8). Belay from gear or the giant eyebolts on the right of Saber Ledge.P2. From Saber ledge, contemplate what lies ahead. The second pitch begins with instant exposure, and the airy step off Saber ledge may be the pyschological crux of the climb. Begin by traversing obvious holds leading left and slightly up from Saber ledge. Though intimidating, the traverse is easier than it looks, and giant holds await you on the arete. It is possible to protect the traverse with a reasonable small alien on the face, otherwise it may be possible to place large gear (with long slings!) above Saber ledge before beginning. Upon reaching the arete, climb past two bolts and follow your nose and your gear.P3. From the alcove on the face, continue upwards on increasingly slabby terrain, following the intermittent cracks for protection. Like many routes on upper Castle, the exact line is not obvious; expect some runouts on easier terrain.. Belay at the top.To descend, follow the trail off the back of the summit to Logger's Ledge.",

Led 1st and 3rd \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Lead pitch 2 and 3. Airy traverse was difficult. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Archival only - lead all pitches at different times. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Led 2nd two pitches. Linked them. The exposed traverse is pretty trivial, basically just step onto it. It\u2019s lower than I thought. Below the anchor. Do not traverse high. \u00b7 Follow. \u00b7 Lead. With Aaron, lead p2 \u00b7 Follow. Followed Aaron for RGC, hard climb \u00b7 Follow. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 2 pitches. Follow. Dylan\u2019s lead RGC \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Led odds this time. Harder than I remember. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Led pitch 1,3; followed pitch 2, the airy exposure freezes you for real. I feel like the name \"Canary\" doesn't summarize the route especially pitch 2. Maybe smth like \"flash marriage\" etc, would make a better name to show how pitch 2 makes you feel? - It's fun for some people, and you keep telling yourself it's gonna be fine, yet your legs can't help shaking the closer you get. \u00b7 Two bee stings today :( incredibly fun though \u00b7 Follow. Part of AMTL1 \u00b7 Switched Leads (Steve Green) \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Flash. With Anya. Led P1 \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Flash. Led the airy step, Billy led the first pitch. Linked with catapult \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. \u00b7 Lead. First pitch Chuck lead. Hard lead. Top under roof really challenging even on TR. second pitch scary start lean out and make about 6 moves to face bolt. Then another bolt and then a horizontal crack for gear. Hard to tell where belay for 3rd pitch should be. I needed more small cams. Upper part of climb easy. Top out nice and walk off good \u00b7 Lead. Led pitch 1 and 2. Chris T led pitch 3. \u00b7 Swap leads with Bryce \u00b7 Lead. Lead P1, Amy linked P2-3 \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 Follow. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Only did first pitch with Jessica's. It's so good!... Except that beginning is heady, it's a definite DNF situation up about 15 feet high but you have to traverse up to the right to get to the crack. The second pitch start also looks quite heady. Jessica had NO interest. \u00b7 2 pitches. Follow. \u2022 No names/notes \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Finished with Hal. I was gifted the 2nd pitch. The move around the arete was a treat along with the rest of the pitch. The walk down was very chill. Great climb! \u00b7 Lead. Did w Ian \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Last route of the day, lead p1 and had to hang, followed p2 \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 Follow. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. max took the money pitch and i went for the full value // extra credit line on pitch 1, following the left crack. shoulda brought a #3! that crack at the roof was wet and sketch and a #3 the flake would\u2019ve decently protected the traverse over to the lip at the top of the other crack. the lieback on the left crack was worth it tho \u00b7 Led pitches 1 & 3, nice day with Emilio \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. With KB. Linked pitch 2-3. Absolutely mind blowing second pitch. So amazing. Loved it. \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. \u00b7 Lead. Led the first pitch, traversed in from the left. Protected well. Couple pitons along the way. Max led the traverse. A little thin. I led the easy bit to the top. Finished the same as Midway. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. \u00b7 Rained out. Did not even get to climb it. tony rap off a piton. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Super fun classic \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. led p1, p3. two false starts off the deck, then got it clean once i started off the arete. one hang in the crux, pumped out \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. \u00b7 Follow. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. \u00b7 1 pitch.

Top roped first pitch with redirect from bolted anchor after leading first pitch of saber. No takes needed, fun climb! \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Actually got P1 clean! Took the left protectable start (tried direct and bailed). #0.1-4, with double #0.3-2 and NUTS and 6 sport draws, 6 single alpine draws. P2 traverse was easy for me but Alexis didn\u2019t like it. All pitches are gear anchors, but standing belays! \u00b7 Follow. \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Led 1st pitch \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Follow was fine, lead was heady and not tactically done in the slightest but I didnt stitch it up \u00b7 Lead. Diana led P1 (stout), I led P2, Andrew P3. \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Swap leads, felt better than first time, linked p2-3 \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 Lead / Pinkpoint.

Did not climb the rest of the route. \u00b7 Lead. Did this originally in 2021 with ceasar. The first pitch was difficult at the time.

Alex lead all routes, and I followed. Amazing views. We ended up doing a very small third pitch. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Got stuck in the coal mine for a little bit.

Coolest 5.8 ever!!! The traverse is way cool and looks way harder then it is. Careful not to barn door and in a few moves you are at the glory jug \u00b7 Follow. \u00b7 1 pitch.

Lead / Onsight. \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Old Grey Mare start was so much better, not run out. I almost led 1st pitch clean, had to take a few times to get the last move. Getting the right foot established in the high V is key *before* trying to reach the finish jugs. 2nd pitch start has hidden funky #2 placement that helps a lot. From there, continued 2nd pitch all the way to the summit. \u00b7 1 pitch. Follow. \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 Follow. Followed clean, no falls. First pitch is vertical under roof 5.8+ climbing good pro.

Sustained 5.8+ climbing a lot of face moves. Third pitch is mostly chill, lots of runout but chunky climbing, look for fixed piton, made rope anchor off rock up top for epic topout. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. lead all 3. Josh 2nd \u00b7 1 pitch.

I finished it off. then we continued on to the summit on Midway \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Went back down for my single #4 \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Only used the 4 & 5 at the very top. A 6 seems like it would\u2019ve prevented a lot of fiddling with marginal pro. \u00b7 TR. \u00b7 TR. \u00b7 TR. Rowdy! \u00b7 TR. \u00b7 TR. Tronsight \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 TR. \u00b7 TR. TR after failed lead \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 TR. \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Brutal \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Spicy \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. \u00b7 Follow. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. \u00b7 TR. kind of did the chimney variation on tr almost the whole way. w Chad, Andrew, Sudah \u00b7 Follow. This was fun which I probably could have lead \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Awesome route. Burly! Should try for the send. \u00b7 TR. lots of left shoulder scraping, lots of takes \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Much less intimidating than it looks from the ground. Ton of gear and features to stop this from being a pure crack. Would climb again. \u00b7 TR. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Fun route Bumped a # 4 (2 #4s would be nice)on the lower then a # 6 on the upper upper took some finger size pieces to protect \u00b7 TR. \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 Follow. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Finally!! I am now worthy! \u00b7 TR. Stellar!!! Probably something you want to headpoint\u2026or maybe someone should ad a bolt or too \u00b7 TR. hmm, it turns out that the chimney and above is quite easy if ya just use chimney techniques the whole way...last time I turned around after the wide part, which ratchets up the difficulty. I was facing the road while chimneying, which seemed wrong before, but is definitely the way to go. The lower section is still as greasy as ever... \u00b7 TR. Burly! Even on top rope. I obviously need more practice with this style of climbing. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Get your head together. Runout chimney \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 TR. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Physical but fun. No laybacking needed - jams and feet are there. #5 useless in the chimney, backed off the lead..Max was able to run it out and find some secret small gear, but still very bold \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 Lead / Flash. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to back clean ALOT \u00b7 TR. Clean on TR, hard first 15' and stays hard the whole way. Amazing climb! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. I entered the chimney with my back facing the road, which made it seemingly impossible to turn around at the constriction. Sooo, I pulled on my #6 to turn around. Otherwise, my send was clean. Next time I should save a #3 for use up high. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 TR. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. \u00b7 TR. Awesome climbing!! \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 Follow. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. didn't have a 4,5, or 6.... \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 TR. Climbed clean. Set rope from Midway. \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. \u00b7 Follow. \u2022 No names/notes \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 TR. Slipped and fell about 20 ft up. \u00b7 TR. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. So this pitch might be one of the best in the state; great jams, stacks and stems the whole way. Not a single necessary lieback. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. super fun. fun layback to chimney stemming . exactly what you want for a chimney route \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. w dan, maggie, vera \u00b7 Follow. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Really odd gear, but a fantastic route! The crux felt down low with the two #4s, but the rest was more secure, just cryptic. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. tricky gear at top. left shoulder in at upper chimney \u00b7 TR. Not a lot of crack climbing for me. Got really big quickly. Top seemed spooky to lead but really fun climbing!"

The Beckey sandbag strikes again :) respect the historic grade but imo felt comparable in difficulty to other 5.7+/5.8 trad climbs elsewhere (even elsewhere in Leavenworth). anyway, super fun, worth doing, and gorgeous at the top. brought a #4 and did place it on p1.

Followed Amy up this route. Tricky jump and traverse \u00b7 Lead / Flash. 2#4 and 1#5 would be nice to protect pitch 1 for new lead to stay calm. Crux comes to the final part, gaining the tower from a ledge, as the main wall is too clean, and I right knee jammed in the large crack, left foot stem on the tower, would be nice to protect with #4; to start pitch 2, stand as close to the main wall as possible, lean onto it with hands, move right foot over, place a pro, then push onto the main wall with left foot, climb up the corner onto a ledge to the left, traverse right aim for the ring, looking for good foot holds, hands on crack where pros can be placed, once reach the gully, climb up through it, reaching the belay station, build gear anchor; didn't remember the details of pitch 3, mostly traverse up and right meeting a sweet deep crack, climb along the crack, then take the least steep line on the right edge (no pro here but quite easy slab), wrap around the horn as anchor. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. W Jeremy Led p2 Fun and beautiful river view Lots of pitons #4 and #5 helpful \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. First climb post injury.

Led all three pitches. 1st pitch - used a #4 in the wider crack above (crux move). Laying back on the main wall and using the jello tower for smearing (chimney move) and using the heel toe technique for the crack. 2nd pitch - Start was airy - lying on the main wall and right leg on it used a yellow totam to protect (I asked the follower from the party before us to place it for me to avoid a factor 2 fall incase I wasn\u2019t able to make the move). I went up and traversed right a bit using the finger crack and went up diagonally again. In hindsight I should have traversed right low and gone to the wide gully and up. That would have been easier. Belayed from gear for this pitch. Pitch 3 - easier pitch and a bit run out at the end. Just used a purple totam on the crack and went up. Walk off - Easy walk off leading to a trail. \u00b7 Follow. \u2022 No names/notes \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Flash. P2. Followed by Conrad C. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Led Pitch 1 and 3.

Lead / Redpoint. P1 \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. \u00b7 Follow. with Nick \u00b7 Lead. Climbed with Grace. Quite fun. No 4 this time, so the protection through the first pitch was just small cams. Kind of committing there until you reach the piton. Awkward but less awkward than last time. P1 belay is awkward. The step across wasn't bad and you can place a piece (.75 I think) before doing it. And also a yellow Metolius up higher in a nice little crack. Didn't even clip the piton, it looks like the head is kind of bent and hard to clip anyways. Second pitch was great. Went straight up for a ways and found the ring pin. Traverse was fun. A little heady but solid. Third pitch is fine, pretty easy, not super long. Beautiful horn up top to sling to belay from. Walk off wasn't too bad or too long. Overall a fun route.

Super fun route, stiff for 5.6 (at least the chimney). Appreciated having the 4\u201d topping out the chimney & for the belay (one can clean it after topping out Jello Tower). Beneficial to climb through to the alcove stance using 3\u201d/4\u201d & tips for anchor. Bump up & right after 20\u2019 climbing. Traverse was awesome, funky pro led to great corner/ ledge belay w small nut, \u201c1, & purple totem. Funky start & initial 20\u2019 to the awesome hand crack to wicked cool puzzle-hueco face. Pro was thin, a wrong sequence could prove dangerous but otherwise it is simple & fun!

Former PNW crusher Kyle O'Meara envisioned a direct start up beautiful white rock which would allow the route to be climbed in one pitch. Unfortunatly, Kyle ran out of bolts, and was only able to sink in the first three. Nonetheless it didnt keep Kyle from freeing the line with a stick clip to start and traditional pro (a few cams and a sea of manky fixed pins) through the upper crux bulge. This half-finished pseudo-\"traditional\" version saw possibly just one additional free ascent over the next few years. In the spring of 2014, Dave Morales, added the missing couple of bolts to the direct start, replaced the manky fixed pins through the upper crux with bolts, and added a lower 2-bolt anchor.The route begins with beautiful climbing using perfect edges and side-pulls on aesthetic white stone. From a midway rest ledge a perplexing bouldery crux leads to a more moderate finish up a shallow corner system.",

The rock in the dihedral has been polished to a slippery, disconcerting, mirror-like sheen.  When you hit a diaganol crack heading up to the left follow it to Saber ledge.  Belay from bolts. (~90 feet)P2.  A few easy moves (~5.5) on the left side of a wide chimney take you up onto emminently forgettable and blocky terrain.  The climbing gets easier as you ascend, and I found myself on 4th or 3rd class terrain long before reaching the top of Castle rock (~190 feet).I've stuck with the historical rating for this climb, which may be a bit of a sandbag-- a more realistic rating for the first pitch may be 5.6.  Combined with the polished rock, this route is probably not the best choice for a fledgling trad leader.  One star for history and for being an accesible moderate as well as a good place to booty gear, but I can't imagine wanting to do this twice.",

With Kyle... Not going to claim lead. Starting move is stiff and remains sustained through the little roof problem. Then eases up to first place we built anchor (to better see the follower off deck). Fun airy traverse to left to next anchor. Then a wandering slabby area where I found hard to protect.

Took Andy \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. First pitch going left at the flakes to avoid bees. Missed ledge, so went right around corner and up. Horrendous rope drag, but linked a 70m to rock with arch at top \u00b7 Follow. First pitch. Went up right and connected to some route over there \u00b7 Lead. \u00b7 4 pitches.

The first few moves to get on the route were more like 5.8/5.9. It's the bouldery direct-start section.....maybe I wasn't supposed to start from there? I cheated this part with some aid climbing involved.

I did not have any small cams upon reaching the slab + corner finger crack so ended up running it out.

We stopped at the bolted anchors 30 feet? before the tree. (mostly because that it was what the party before us did). The corner/groove leading up to the second crux was a little sketch...mostly due to moss, but the protection was not super awesome. Moss made it look like it doesn't see much traffic. Rock in that area sided on the edge of hollow in my opinion...and since when are rusted pitons placed likely 30+ years ago called \"good?\" We belayed at the ledge below the second crux. (The party ahead of us bailed here bc they got sketched out at the crux). At the second crux, I climbed the crack just before the arete to do this part...thought i could get more gear? ...which was fine, but again...that old bolt/hanger has seen much better days, and blowing it before getting a second piece would of super sucked no matter how you did it. Rest of pitch 3 was fun, but definitely warm in the sun! Best for a bit of a cooler day. First 2 pitches stayed in the shade pretty late, so that was awesome. (one of the bigger reasons we did it). Where we stopped for our belays did not really affect the climb for better or worse (that I could tell). Long story short...climb was fun/worth doing, but did not always have super bomber gear (in my opinion), so be prepared for a little spice. <3 Jul 7, 2014",

One can lead belay up followers and link this route up with p2 and p3 of Midway with minimal rope drag by building a rope anchor around the pinnacle at the top of the route (before the traverse to the shared anchors at the top of jello tower). We belayed the last climber to the jello tower /Midway chains once we were all up and just prussik belayed ourselves over on that strand once he had built an anchor there for added safety, but the walk over isn\u2019t too bad. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 2 takes at the crux because I'm weak and scared.
