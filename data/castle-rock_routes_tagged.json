No move or jam is harder than 10a. \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Climbed after Damnation and already roasted. Many falls. Probably can float it top rope when fresh. \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Got it clean after one fall (lowered to the ground) but quite difficult and slippery \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell right at top of finger crack. So so fun \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Flash. Fun little one to work fingers on. Feat are slick \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Just the first two pitches. P1 is amazing with bomber locks the whole way. P2 is a bit of a dirty vision quest, would call it 5.8+R but it goes! Doubles (0.2- 0.5) single (0.75-3) offset nuts 8 Alpines 70m \u00b7 Follow. Nathan led the opening moves in style, actually all of it! Second pitch was a vision quest. OW at end of first pitch is way easier than it looks \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Only P1. Pulled and hung on quite a few on lower half of finger crack. Single 0.2, double 0.3-0.5, and single #5 (by the piton at start of wide crack). You actually don\u2019t need to offwidth anything at the top, it has nice holds. Two alpine draws (top of finger crack and then the #5. \u00b7 Follow. Crack itself is super slick and the face is pretty smooth too, making foot moves hard. Continued on easy terrain to summit, 2nd of 3 for the day. \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. First pitch only, finger crack very fun, upper slab very insecure but fun \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Slipped, almost gave up but glad I went back for send \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. finger crack lead. not graceful but I got up it. .4s were helpful \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. a fall or two... but can probably lead this one next time \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Climbed first 20 feet many times. Just long enough to think \"this is harder than I expected\" then you're at the top \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. scared of damnation crack but willing to run out most of the offwidth \u00b7 1 pitch. Follow. I wish it were longer. Sweet finger locks in a polished crack \u00b7 TR. Logan ran up it and it was so nice to watch him climb so effortlesly \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Bow valley levels of polish. Crazy body tension to keep the feet on. \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Just the finger crack. Hard but got it clean after dialing in the start \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. Fell/took ~5x then redpoint w 2 pieces pre-clipped. Feels 10c/d? \u00b7 Lead. Swapped leads w/ Daniel. Took on P1 on follow. P2 lots of rope stretch. Fun topout! \u00b7 1 pitch. Follow. So greasy! Don\u2019t like the decking potential or the weird traverse. Wide crack was cool. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Difficult. Slick. .3\u2019s and .4\u2019s. Piton and micro cam protects the offwidth. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Set a TR at the top of the finger crack after struggling to lead it. Climbed it on TR clean twice. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Fun warm-up!! Got rained out after with Jonas so no main course. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. w dan, maggie, vera. just to horn, didn't do 5.7 part above \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Pretty strenuous for me but my blue and black totems protected it really well! \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Very slippery finger crack! Not Emily sized so more ring locks but good practice to see what an \u201ceasy\u201d finger crack feels like! \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. in the dark my headlamp was dying I couldn't see the feet \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Yikes that\u2019s slick. If you can get past the first few moves then it\u2019s super fun \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Slipped out of hand jam! Fingers are bomber, the trick is to find the feet. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. great finger locks, feet are glass, back step to micro left facing corner. try to skip .5 section to next hand jam. first peice black totem to leave good locks open.",

A memorable line, Canary combines interesting climbing with terrific exposure.Approximately 100 feet to the left of Saber, a short section of face climbing leads to a right facing dihedral and a broken crack system that reaches the left side of Saber ledge. This is the start of Canary.P1. Begin by climbing approximately 15 feet of unprotected face to the base of a right facing dihedral. This section is not trivial, but the holds are positive and it is no harder than 5.7. Alternatively, it may be possible to begin in a small dihedral to the left and traverse right to gain the crack system at the top of the face. From the top of the face, follow the dihedral and subsequent crack systems up with good gear. Ascend until you are under the giant roof, then break right onto Saber ledge at the top of the crack system. This pitch is the technical crux of the climb, culminating in the moves up and onto Saber Ledge (5.8). Belay from gear or the giant eyebolts on the right of Saber Ledge.P2. From Saber ledge, contemplate what lies ahead. The second pitch begins with instant exposure, and the airy step off Saber ledge may be the pyschological crux of the climb. Begin by traversing obvious holds leading left and slightly up from Saber ledge. Though intimidating, the traverse is easier than it looks, and giant holds await you on the arete. It is possible to protect the traverse with a reasonable small alien on the face, otherwise it may be possible to place large gear (with long slings!) above Saber ledge before beginning. Upon reaching the arete, climb past two bolts and follow your nose and your gear.P3. From the alcove on the face, continue upwards on increasingly slabby terrain, following the intermittent cracks for protection. Like many routes on upper Castle, the exact line is not obvious; expect some runouts on easier terrain.. Belay at the top.To descend, follow the trail off the back of the summit to Logger's Ledge.",

Led 2nd two pitches. Linked them. The exposed traverse is pretty trivial, basically just step onto it. It\u2019s lower than I thought. Below the anchor. Do not traverse high. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Led pitch 1,3; followed pitch 2, the airy exposure freezes you for real. I feel like the name \"Canary\" doesn't summarize the route especially pitch 2. Maybe smth like \"flash marriage\" etc, would make a better name to show how pitch 2 makes you feel? - It's fun for some people, and you keep telling yourself it's gonna be fine, yet your legs can't help shaking the closer you get. \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Flash. Led the airy step, Billy led the first pitch. Linked with catapult \u00b7 Lead. First pitch Chuck lead. Hard lead. Top under roof really challenging even on TR. second pitch scary start lean out and make about 6 moves to face bolt. Then another bolt and then a horizontal crack for gear. Hard to tell where belay for 3rd pitch should be. I needed more small cams. Upper part of climb easy. Top out nice and walk off good \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Only did first pitch with Jessica's. It's so good!... Except that beginning is heady, it's a definite DNF situation up about 15 feet high but you have to traverse up to the right to get to the crack. The second pitch start also looks quite heady. Jessica had NO interest. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Finished with Hal. I was gifted the 2nd pitch. The move around the arete was a treat along with the rest of the pitch. The walk down was very chill. Great climb! \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Last route of the day, lead p1 and had to hang, followed p2 \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. max took the money pitch and i went for the full value // extra credit line on pitch 1, following the left crack. shoulda brought a #3! that crack at the roof was wet and sketch and a #3 the flake would\u2019ve decently protected the traverse over to the lip at the top of the other crack. the lieback on the left crack was worth it tho \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. With KB. Linked pitch 2-3. Absolutely mind blowing second pitch. So amazing. Loved it. \u00b7 Lead. Led the first pitch, traversed in from the left. Protected well. Couple pitons along the way. Max led the traverse. A little thin. I led the easy bit to the top. Finished the same as Midway. \u00b7 Rained out. Did not even get to climb it. tony rap off a piton. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. led p1, p3. two false starts off the deck, then got it clean once i started off the arete. one hang in the crux, pumped out \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. P1 only; ran out of daylight to do the stepover move on P2 :( \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. spooky for 5.8! plus a museum's worth of questionable pins in the jam crack. got dark so we called it after p1 \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Top roped first pitch with redirect from bolted anchor after leading first pitch of saber. No takes needed, fun climb! \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Actually got P1 clean! Took the left protectable start (tried direct and bailed). #0.1-4, with double #0.3-2 and NUTS and 6 sport draws, 6 single alpine draws. P2 traverse was easy for me but Alexis didn\u2019t like it. All pitches are gear anchors, but standing belays! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Follow was fine, lead was heady and not tactically done in the slightest but I didnt stitch it up \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Swap leads, felt better than first time, linked p2-3 \u00b7 Lead / Pinkpoint. Led pitch 1/3 Felt stiff for the grade on the first pitch because of a polished dihedral at the second half of pitch one. Easy climbing otherwise. \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Led the first pitch of Saber and set up a TR on the first pitch of Canary. Did not climb the rest of the route. \u00b7 Lead. Did this originally in 2021 with ceasar. The first pitch was difficult at the time. Followed it this time and it seemed a little easier but pulling over the ledge is burly . Enjoyed leading the next two pitches- fun airy moves \u00b7 Follow. Alex lead all routes, and I followed. Amazing views. We ended up doing a very small third pitch. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Got stuck in the coal mine for a little bit. Some slick moves got this canary flying up the wall. fun climb, great views. \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead. Sam led first pitch. Several takes at high point but sent bouldery finish in one go. I hung at top of ledge following. I led second pitch from saber ledge to top out in one long pitch. \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead. With Ryan. Started first 15ft of OGM then moved right. Combined 1st 2-pitches. 2 pitches total to top. \u00b7 Follow. Logan led the whole thing, felt very sandbagged, crux move on first pitch felt like 10a \u00b7 Follow. followed lead, one hung pitch 1 to grab a cam I forgot. amazing route. \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. So tricky, I stank of fear by the end and it was amazing \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. w Paul. TR P1 after doing P1 of Saber and getting lowered at the base of Canary. pumpy towards the end by some good resting options and I feel it protects very well (?). except start which is runout -> next time start at Old Gray Mare and avoid runout... \u00b7 Follow. Coolest 5.8 ever!!! The traverse is way cool and looks way harder then it is. Careful not to barn door and in a few moves you are at the glory jug \u00b7 Follow. A spectacular route, from the strenuous and challenging first pitch to the mental ballet of the second. Unforgettable. \u00b7 Follow. Hot day in Leavenworth w/ Cam Did Old Grey Mare as part of Pitch 1, might have been easier sticking to the slab Cooled off in the river after! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Lead p2, Chris led 1 and 3. scary canary traverse is easy. Another good canidate for simuling in one long pitch, just plug a microtrax on the bolt after the p2 traverse \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Old Grey Mare start was so much better, not run out. I almost led 1st pitch clean, had to take a few times to get the last move. Getting the right foot established in the high V is key *before* trying to reach the finish jugs. 2nd pitch start has hidden funky #2 placement that helps a lot. From there, continued 2nd pitch all the way to the summit. \u00b7 Follow. Followed clean, no falls. First pitch is vertical under roof 5.8+ climbing good pro. Second pitch is exposed first couple moves, protect with .3 in face hold, make two committing moves on good holds plug #2 in above jug, continue up to first bolt. Sustained 5.8+ climbing a lot of face moves. Third pitch is mostly chill, lots of runout but chunky climbing, look for fixed piton, made rope anchor off rock up top for epic topout. \u00b7 4 pitches. Follow. Did with James Kan with mountain project, initial step on 2nd pitch very airy \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Started up Face. Was sketchy, should\u2019ve done the crack. Super fun, linked 2 and 3 with a 70 and lots of extension and runout on the easy slabs without too much rope drag \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Max lead the first 2 pitches. Haley lead the easy 3rd pitch. What an awesome climb! I would not have wanted to lead the 1st pitch- it has a couple of very committing moves, but could do the 2nd. Max started in the left corner. It was a beautiful day today with perfect temperatures! Plus we were the only ones there:) \u00b7 Follow. So much fun! Loved the step across and all of the features. w Olivia / LWGs \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. The mantle move on P1 is much harder then the step-across move on P2, and both protect well. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Only led P1 cuz Allie and I were melting in the sun. Should have started earlier. P1 was burly. Got it clean but it was a bit stout. Nearly whipped at the top out but I made it. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead. P1 was awesome, heavy rain rolled in while preparing for second pitch and we bailed \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead. Climbed w/ Jesse Reinking. Jesse led pitch 1, I led pitch 2. \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Climbed w/ Eric who knows when. Couldn't hear each other, thought there was an emergency, descended the fixed line, found Eric, bored at the bottom",

                "route_tick_comments": "\u00b7 Follow. Fell at first crack, should have liebacked. Then twice in the off width. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Clean to chimney, then bailed. Not confident enough in chimney technique to launch into it without #6 \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Need an large cam to protect the chimney moves otherwise you need to run it out. Stiff start to the ledge. Personally felt like 10b, but giving it 10a PG13 rating. \u00b7 TR. Slipped on first move :-(. Otherwise ok. Layback first 6 moves after that felt ok. \u00b7 TR. Enjoyed this climb so much!! Lower bit is slippery, had to get creative with techniques between stemming, foot jams, elbow, butterfly stack, hand-fist stack but all felt very secure. A little weird getting into the chimney but remembered the foot-knee bar then got sendy! One awkward turnaround then solid! \u00b7 TR. Laps on the lower section to figure out sequence. Laybacking still feels comfortable over the Keira way. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. 3 3s and 3 4s and rack them both on your right hand side. 6 tips out 80 percent of the time but wouldn\u2019t go up without it. I climbed this with offwidth/fists technique and did not layback but as per usual did whatever it takes to avoid laybacking \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Ok one fall like half a foot off the ground, landed on my feet doesn't count. Damn fine crack. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Resorted to laybacking cuz I suck at the #4's section. Bring doubles of black toteys (or nuts)-#1, one #2, three #3's, three #4's, #5, and #6. \u00b7 TR. Not a gimme! Cruxy bottom, flaring chimney, little bit of interesting face if you use the top left bolts. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Old school 5.9. Need to climb more corner cracks, #4 cracks, and little pro chimneys \u00b7 TR. Best chimney I've ever climbed. Some fine fellows let us take TR laps. Stoked to come back and lead that shit. \u00b7 Follow. Jesse lead and I followed. It was a delight to follow. Seems a bit spooky to lead but I didn\u2019t fall on follow. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead it halfway up with a few falls and gave up on the chimney because I didn't have good gear to protect it so I lowered off. \u00b7 TR. Completed a realistic mock lead successfully in preparation to lead this in the future. Fun climb requiring a variety of techniques! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. #6 takes out the scare factor. Glad to finally get on it \u00b7 Lead. I thought it was difficult\u2014- the chimney section was heady\u2026.being a #6 if you want to not runout the chimney. I did NOT do that and I was scared. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on the bottom section transitioning from a lie back top has plenty of pro bring a 3 or a 4 for the top \u00b7 Follow. Such physical climbing. Amazing route. Glass feet and hard layback to start and hard chimney and OW. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. What a barfight! Used a bigbro but could\u2019ve went without. Happy to have 2x BD #4s. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. sent the first half, still too scared of the chimney. had to climb south face to rescue my gear \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Didn\u2019t have enough small gear and left the 6 in the car. Felt so sketchy starting up the chimney with no idea if there as gear anywhere till the .75. If I knew where every piece I ended up placing was, I would\u2019ve been more comfortable. Chimney start would just be a 10-15ft ground fall essentially \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Got shut down on the lower crack, worked the moves a few times after on TR and started to feel really solid. Great climb for improving my crack technique \u00b7 TR. Tough layback start. Really wide and polished. Could protect with a #4. Good rest platform 1/2ish way up. Burley chimney climbing with little holds/jams to the finish. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Was awkward, athletic, and a bit heady. Could have used very small or very large gear. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Climbed some time last month. Can't believe I waited so long to try it \u00b7 TR. did as much of DDD on the left before starting this one. fell once in the chimney \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. I led up the the crack then bailed at the chimney. Ben followed that and then led 3/4 up the chimney and bailed there. I finished it off. then we continued on to the summit on Midway \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Only used the 4 & 5 at the very top. A 6 seems like it would\u2019ve prevented a lot of fiddling with marginal pro. \u00b7 TR. kind of did the chimney variation on tr almost the whole way. w Chad, Andrew, Sudah \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Much less intimidating than it looks from the ground. Ton of gear and features to stop this from being a pure crack. Would climb again. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Fun route Bumped a # 4 (2 #4s would be nice)on the lower then a # 6 on the upper upper took some finger size pieces to protect \u00b7 TR. Stellar!!! Probably something you want to headpoint\u2026or maybe someone should ad a bolt or too \u00b7 TR. hmm, it turns out that the chimney and above is quite easy if ya just use chimney techniques the whole way...last time I turned around after the wide part, which ratchets up the difficulty. I was facing the road while chimneying, which seemed wrong before, but is definitely the way to go. The lower section is still as greasy as ever... \u00b7 TR. Burly! Even on top rope. I obviously need more practice with this style of climbing. \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Physical but fun. No laybacking needed - jams and feet are there. #5 useless in the chimney, backed off the lead..Max was able to run it out and find some secret small gear, but still very bold \u00b7 TR. Clean on TR, hard first 15' and stays hard the whole way. Amazing climb! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. I entered the chimney with my back facing the road, which made it seemingly impossible to turn around at the constriction. Sooo, I pulled on my #6 to turn around. Otherwise, my send was clean. Next time I should save a #3 for use up high. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. So this pitch might be one of the best in the state; great jams, stacks and stems the whole way. Not a single necessary lieback. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. super fun. fun layback to chimney stemming . exactly what you want for a chimney route \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Really odd gear, but a fantastic route! The crux felt down low with the two #4s, but the rest was more secure, just cryptic. \u00b7 TR. Not a lot of crack climbing for me. Got really big quickly. Top seemed spooky to lead but really fun climbing!",

This protects very well and getting into and over the bulge at the bottom of the crack is the crux.

Isaac lead after that into Winter Solstice. Jessica joined us as well. \u00b7 TR. TR clean.

Tricky to read, rad movement. I pulled the roof via power laybacks and got my left knee bar in which would be great for placing gear and then pulling the final moves out. At start, purple TCU or #6 brass up in the crack to protect opening moves then blue totem at the top of the chalked flake. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Gaston Undercling left hand, right it the finger crack rail, left to the good juggish Stay near the Arete and then stay left above bulge \u00b7 TR. Sent it clean on TR during my second try. I'd definitely lead this route. There are great placements where they're needed. \u00b7 TR. Botched the traverse and swung down to a blanket face and needed a boost. Really neat pulling around the bulge to the right \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell a couple times at the crux. Use hands out left. \u00b7 TR. couldn't pull the roof. 3-finger under cling + lft sidepull to another first her lft sidepull then high jug above crack \u00b7 Lead.

Pulled on a piece to make the p2 step - reachy for shorties. The Beckey sandbag strikes again :) respect the historic grade but imo felt comparable in difficulty to other 5.7+/5.8 trad climbs elsewhere (even elsewhere in Leavenworth). anyway, super fun, worth doing, and gorgeous at the top. brought a #4 and did place it on p1. Linked p2&3 accidentally (with 70m) but would recommend doing it again on purpose - created some drag but not terrible, and p3 is very short. definitely bring radios. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Led the whole thing! Was not scared. Placed minimal gear. And built my first trad anchor! Linked the last 2 pitches with an 80m. \u00b7 Follow. Sarah led. First time leading me completely on a trad multi. Also her 1st gear anchor. Could do as one mega pitch with 80m and stayingnin the dihedral direct on the 1st pitch. Nice views. Some old pitons to clip. :) \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. w/ Ben and Laura (first p). Great swim in the creek after \u00b7 1 pitch. Follow. TL lead. DL not up to hop over from pillar to lead 2nd pitch. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Led first and third pitches, vin led the second. Very fun and thoughtful for 5.6 \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Fun route! Idk about 5.6 crux move on p1 felt pretty 5.9y also I was barely able to clip the piton before that move. Still loved every section great final slab jug haul! \u00b7 1 pitch. Follow. Only climbed one pitch to keep it short with a bigger climb/approach tomorrow. Approach was nice and shady. Route itself was relatively shady until just before noon. Some loose rock made this interesting. Fun but challenging route. View from the top of P1 was gorgeous. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead. Tricky first pitch. #4 does not fit in first crack. Best pro down low was a marginal purple nut. Some fun moves and exposure. Steeper than expected. Stiff for 5.6 \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. First pitch, very little pro. Second pitch partner bailed off a sling on a chock stone. Need to go back and pick up the trash we left behind. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Felt a little stiff for a 5.6, I\u2019d give it a 5.7. 2nd pitch traverse and step across were the crux of the route \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Followed p1, lead p2 from right before the face moves to top \u00b7 2 pitches. Follow. Followed from jello tower to the top in one pitch. Right of the big roof which seemed dirty and maybe not the route \u00b7 2 pitches. From the top of jelly tower. I\u2019m not sure if I was on the route. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. 2#4 and 1#5 would be nice to protect pitch 1 for new lead to stay calm. Crux comes to the final part, gaining the tower from a ledge, as the main wall is too clean, and I right knee jammed in the large crack, left foot stem on the tower, would be nice to protect with #4; to start pitch 2, stand as close to the main wall as possible, lean onto it with hands, move right foot over, place a pro, then push onto the main wall with left foot, climb up the corner onto a ledge to the left, traverse right aim for the ring, looking for good foot holds, hands on crack where pros can be placed, once reach the gully, climb up through it, reaching the belay station, build gear anchor; didn't remember the details of pitch 3, mostly traverse up and right meeting a sweet deep crack, climb along the crack, then take the least steep line on the right edge (no pro here but quite easy slab), wrap around the horn as anchor. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. W Jeremy Led p2 Fun and beautiful river view Lots of pitons #4 and #5 helpful \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. First climb post injury. Felt like old school 5.6 for sure, it was real wild climbing this thing and thinking of Fred Beckey doing the same in 1948 with less than ideal gear lol. Great outing after a solid weekend of music! \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. With Jose. He head P1, did a solid job. I took P2/3, reckon Jose\u2019s multipitch skills are coming along. Eager to learn, gotta keep teaching on chill routes. Fun route, final pitches still my favorite! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Led pitches 1 and 3. The first pitch has some weird , insecure moves. \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Skipped 1st pitch, Went up East face instead, then stepped across and did the rest in 1 more pitch. Fun and more interesting than expected. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Led all three pitches. 1st pitch - used a #4 in the wider crack above (crux move). Laying back on the main wall and using the jello tower for smearing (chimney move) and using the heel toe technique for the crack. 2nd pitch - Start was airy - lying on the main wall and right leg on it used a yellow totam to protect (I asked the follower from the party before us to place it for me to avoid a factor 2 fall incase I wasn\u2019t able to make the move). I went up and traversed right a bit using the finger crack and went up diagonally again. In hindsight I should have traversed right low and gone to the wide gully and up. That would have been easier. Belayed from gear for this pitch. Pitch 3 - easier pitch and a bit run out at the end. Just used a purple totam on the crack and went up. Walk off - Easy walk off leading to a trail. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Led Pitch 1 and 3. Had to take a couple of times in the chimney \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Followed pitches 1 and 3. Led pitch 2. Loved the airy step. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. One take on P1 where I screwed up the beta. Linked P2 and P3 clean. \u00b7 2 pitches. Follow. Climbed in 2 pitches. P1 as South Face Jello Tower ending across the step off; P2 to the top with a 70m rope. Hung on P1. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Lead all three pitches. Not a great first 5.6 multi pitch for the 5.6 multi pitch leader but a really great climb: great pro, fun moves, very picturesque, easy legit walkoff, and more! Clip-a-piton fun. \u00b7 Lead. Swung leads with student for MP class. Ended up breaking into 4 pitches because forgot about going right to get into gulley feature. 3rd pitch fun and knobs \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. was lead leader:) did it with kali followed by lecia and kathleen \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. With Emma, Jorge and Butch. Fun little route with a spicy move or 2 \u00b7 1 pitch. Follow. Bailed at the top of jello tower due to heat, and lack of water and stoke \u00b7 1 pitch. Follow. Fallowed in first pitch and it was rough Was to hot and late in the day to keep climbing \u00b7 Lead. 5.6 ?!?! Riiiiiight *wink, wink* Lead 1st pitch. Tony lead second pitch. Did not find the third. \u00b7 Follow. Started left of the actual start. Was fun. Sketchy to step over the abyss \u00b7 Lead. Used 2x 5 for first pitch again. Can place small cams in pin scars. Tricams good \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Climbing was okay but unique route. Follow the mass amount of pitons! \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. Just did the first pitch and set up a top rope. \u00b7 Lead. Climbed with Grace. Quite fun. No 4 this time, so the protection through the first pitch was just small cams. Kind of committing there until you reach the piton. Awkward but less awkward than last time. P1 belay is awkward. The step across wasn't bad and you can place a piece (.75 I think) before doing it. And also a yellow Metolius up higher in a nice little crack. Didn't even clip the piton, it looks like the head is kind of bent and hard to clip anyways. Second pitch was great. Went straight up for a ways and found the ring pin. Traverse was fun. A little heady but solid. Third pitch is fine, pretty easy, not super long. Beautiful horn up top to sling to belay from. Walk off wasn't too bad or too long. Overall a fun route. It's in the sun so would be nice on a cooler day. \u00b7 1 pitch. just first pitch, checking out Shelby's gear placements! some rope stuck shenanigans after I rapped down \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead. Finished on this with Bedard after coming in from winter solstice \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Love the onsight guide. Super fun route, stiff for 5.6 (at least the chimney). Appreciated having the 4\u201d topping out the chimney & for the belay (one can clean it after topping out Jello Tower). Beneficial to climb through to the alcove stance using 3\u201d/4\u201d & tips for anchor. Bump up & right after 20\u2019 climbing. Traverse was awesome, funky pro led to great corner/ ledge belay w small nut, \u201c1, & purple totem. Funky start & initial 20\u2019 to the awesome hand crack to wicked cool puzzle-hueco face. Pro was thin, a wrong sequence could prove dangerous but otherwise it is simple & fun! Plentiful boulder/ horn belay options on the summit. 3.5/4* \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Would have placed a big piece 5or 6??if I had one for the first pitch.",

Was very scared. would have liked more jugs for a 5.6/7 \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. think I did this but just to the step across and lowered from anchors on top of the tower \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Lead P2, could have gone all the way to the top but stopped at ropes midpoint for some reason. Really this is just a two pitch route, no need for more. \u00b7 Lead. Led p1 and P3 Jed led classic way for P2. I went a bit too far into a chimney on P1 and since the crack got super wide had to traverse back and get back onto the route on slight overhung crack. It went well because I had a \u201chead game\u201d hex placed in the horizontal flake as I was traversing. It was a bomber. P3 anchor is a giant boulder once you top out. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Lead with a #4 nut in the crack to a top rope anchor at the Chains on top of the first pitch (jello tower) \u00b7 Follow. First time climbing at castle rock. Climbing with Devin. Step across at 2nd pitch not near as scary as leapin lizards. Super fun. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Cam #0.3-#2 (optional 0.1-0.2), medium offsets. Single & double length slings (extra 2 double to make horn anchors). 3 pitches. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Tricky routefinding on pitch two, but really fun (fun to run it out, too) \u00b7 Follow. Rob lead both pitches. Super run out and sketchy on pitch 2 but rob had it no problem \u00b7 Aug 2016...the step over is scary! fun climb altogether tho. we did in 2 pitches \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Super fun! Expect a crowd. camalot #4 will make your chimney feel a lot safer on pitch 1. \u00b7 excited to go back and try some of the variations of this route, love climbing on castle \u00b7 First pitch little grunty/ awkward chimney. Airy step leads to fun face. Feels stiffer than 5.6. Crux moves felt 5.7+",

Tricky crux getting over first small bulge. Good gear. \u00b7 TR. Erron and I both top roped. We both fell! I fell, a lot. Realllly hard bulge moves. Slippery and difficulty body positioning \u00b7 TR. Fell lots. Set up TR from south face. Could maybe link together after figuring beta. :) \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. I thought it was over after the first bulge, but the roof proved me wrong! I'd give it more stars if it was a bit less greasy \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Stoked for onsight! Brought way too much gear. Placed black totem, .75, .2, and a couple of .3s at second roof, plus a .5 and a nut. #2 placement in the hand pod below the bulge was trash. Beautiful day at castle rock \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. .3 and .2 before the bulge, pull through with left foot in the crack, right on a small edge. Then .3-4 icee bulge. Save a .3 for over the roof \u00b7 TR. Would be a tough lead, weird hand jams and tough placements on insecure holds. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Second go. Thin ish gear the obvious flare and bulge at the start is the crux it\u2019s pumpy \u00b7 TR. What a struggle oof but some sweet finger jams! First couple finger jams that have felt good for me \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Superrrrrrrrrrb wow locks wowwwwww. Pulled the crux then told myself I don't onsight 11s so then Sat on a piece because brains are weird. \u00b7 3 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Few hangs first go, second go fall at roof. Felt at least as hard as even Steven. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Close but no cigar. Don\u2019t waste time placing so much just take the whip ! \u00b7 2 pitches. TR. 2 laps. First lap not so good. Second lap not much better, but better. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. first Beckey route at a cool crag with maddie. felt ok in the sun with the nice breeze, but certainly hard for the grade \u00b7 TR. crux was a bomber jug with disappearing left feet, smear with right to reach left hand ring lock or grab the inner jug higher on the pod and a sideways ringlock on the right hand to mantle up. \u00b7 TR. Fell/hung Specific hand sequence needed. Coming out of roof, left hand undercling, right hand crack, bring left hand into crack, Frey cut over right, right side pull out right, left hand into compression crack, get feet up high. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Only one hard move off a really good lock definitely felt 5.10 but nothing more \u00b7 TR. Couldn\u2019t get past first bulge crux into second finger crack system... next time! \u00b7 3 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Sequency, but felt easier than MF overhang. Gear: 3, .75, .4, .4, .3, .2 \u00b7 TR. First crux was pumpy and the second was specific (fell 1x there). Next tr - place gear on lead \u00b7 TR. Left hand thumb lock and gaston beta. Placed a 0.5 cam in the pocket on the roof, perfect directional for TR. \u00b7 TR. Hard but fun! Got my right arm stuck after a left finger lock. Can't wait to try it again! \u00b7 Lead but most def not clean haha. Took a SWEET whipper and landed sideways. Burly ass rig",

Former PNW crusher Kyle O'Meara envisioned a direct start up beautiful white rock which would allow the route to be climbed in one pitch. Unfortunatly, Kyle ran out of bolts, and was only able to sink in the first three. Nonetheless it didnt keep Kyle from freeing the line with a stick clip to start and traditional pro (a few cams and a sea of manky fixed pins) through the upper crux bulge. This half-finished pseudo-\"traditional\" version saw possibly just one additional free ascent over the next few years. In the spring of 2014, Dave Morales, added the missing couple of bolts to the direct start, replaced the manky fixed pins through the upper crux with bolts, and added a lower 2-bolt anchor.The route begins with beautiful climbing using perfect edges and side-pulls on aesthetic white stone. From a midway rest ledge a perplexing bouldery crux leads to a more moderate finish up a shallow corner system.",

Look for a left angling ramp just to the right of a large, low roof.  This is the start of Saber.P1.  Climb the left angling ramp to the base of a left facing dihedral.  The rock in the dihedral has been polished to a slippery, disconcerting, mirror-like sheen.  When you hit a diaganol crack heading up to the left follow it to Saber ledge.  Belay from bolts. (~90 feet)P2.  A few easy moves (~5.5) on the left side of a wide chimney take you up onto emminently forgettable and blocky terrain.  The climbing gets easier as you ascend, and I found myself on 4th or 3rd class terrain long before reaching the top of Castle rock (~190 feet).I've stuck with the historical rating for this climb, which may be a bit of a sandbag-- a more realistic rating for the first pitch may be 5.6.  Combined with the polished rock, this route is probably not the best choice for a fledgling trad leader.  One star for history and for being an accesible moderate as well as a good place to booty gear, but I can't imagine wanting to do this twice.",

Stayed too far right and did the finger crack lay back variation. Failed to find the belay anchors but it all worked out \u00b7 4 pitches. Follow. With Kyle... Not going to claim lead. Starting move is stiff and remains sustained through the little roof problem. Then eases up to first place we built anchor (to better see the follower off deck). Fun airy traverse to left to next anchor. Then a wandering slabby area where I found hard to protect. Finally, chossy junk to the summit for a boulder belay. \u00b7 Follow. Couldn\u2019t get the start; took alternate route and got lowered to 1st 2 pieces then got dropped (fall). Attempted to lead 2nd pitch, failed, switched leads. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. First pitch going left at the flakes to avoid bees. Missed ledge, so went right around corner and up. Horrendous rope drag, but linked a 70m to rock with arch at top \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Got off route near end of P1. Trended left underneath a large roof belayed at a micro ledge w 1\u201d, 2\u201d, 4\u201d P2 straight up & right on small cams right above the belay lol. Trend right then straight up for easy slab w small options for gear, belay at alcove. Jose took P3 to the top on scrambling terrain \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. Led actual climb this time, last time did saber direct and finger crack lay back variation. Much easier, but lots of rope drag. \u00b7 Follow. Followed Ben, 1st pitch goes all the way to left after 2 X-marked rocks, over a bigger ledge. 2nd pitch felt tricky even though supposed to be easier. Would not lead myself yet this route. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. With Shelby from SpaceX and his friend Patrick. A few moves felt like solid 5.8+. Not great feet in the harder sections. No bolts at top, needed to sling a horn with the climbing rope. Wouldn\u2019t repeat. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Pitch 1 felt more like 5.7 on lead (or I just suck at chimney climbing). The first few moves to get on the route were more like 5.8/5.9. It's the bouldery direct-start section.....maybe I wasn't supposed to start from there? I cheated this part with some aid climbing involved. Pitch 2 (or pitch 3 in my case) was pretty chill for the most parts except for serious rope drag, and I ran out of alpine draws \u00b7 Lead. Don\u2019t go too high on 2nd pitch. Anchor bolts farther left on the ledge than you think \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Only did the first pitch before setting up a TR on the first pitch of Canary. I did not have any small cams upon reaching the slab + corner finger crack so ended up running it out. This part probably protects best with .3s, there are possible nut placements but a bit finicky. \u00b7 4 pitches. Lead / Flash. Broke into 4 pitches. Led P1, P3, P4, Avalon led P2 \u00b7 Lead / Flash. w Paul. Led P1, felt like 5.6 - not too bad. used chimney technique in first left facing corner. after this dihedral go on the flaky left on the face instead of the polished shiny corner crack. anchor is left still of the face. protects extra well. then lowered to bottom of Canary and top roped P1 of Canary. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead. Just first pitch. Got off route to the right of the ledge. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Definitely felt sandbag for 5.6, slab section of pitch 1 was pretty slick for soft shoes. \u00b7 3 pitches. Follow. w/ Ryan, nice! First pitch really traversed. Wanders. Tough to hear each other (bring radios next time). First belay by airy move of Canary. Gear to #2, no nuts. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Bolts on the P1 ledge are way left, after a ledge, above a different route \u00b7 Solo. is fun. soloed. rapped in way too far left but eventually made the correction. \u00b7 4 pitches. Solo. OS, 2 laps, 5.9 var is sick and secure (3 stars w/ var) [BH: Blu T, Pk Tri] \u00b7 3 pitches. Follow. First pitch is easily 5.8 imo (idk was very hungover). Simuled to second set of bolts and solo\u2019d off \u00b7 4 pitches. Lead. Fun romp. start right. belay off gear at ledge before slick dihedral. traverse hard right and up to canary ledge and bolts. straight up wandering bouldery bits to bolts up left. Boulder belay on top of cruiser section \u00b7 Follow. Multi pitch course, boulder start is a move but its actually awkward then getting out of that pod/chimney. Def go from the right. KK did great. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. 1p quite nice, wish 2 was more than a 5th class jaunt \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Led the 1st pitch and linked up to Century for the \u201c3rd\u201d \u00b7 Lead. Fede led part of P2 up from Saber ledge but stopped at a bolted anchor. I led to the top which barely hit low 5th. Out of water and very dehydrated. Took a nap on the summit. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead. Only did the first pitch and rapped off to go to town and meet erin/quack \u00b7 3 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Started the with Canary as the first pitch, moved over to Saber. Good easy climbing. W/ Natalie and Kristin \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Seconded 1st; led 2nd. hardest move is off the ground. the slab part of pitch 1 had a satisfying traverse but was scary for the leader (Sean went up the seam instead). Pitch 2 was loong and I backcleaned a piece to reduce rope drag. \u00b7 Lead. Led both pitches w Leilani following while tyler and Liam climbed direct start into the second pitch of canary. Bit of route finding as you go ip towards the corner. Opted for flakes. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. climbed first pitch in 3 pitches, upper limit of lead abilities at the moment. think this was more like a 5.7 \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. sam lead first pitch, did the direct start which is probably 5.9 or 5.8, then rather than go into the slippery corner I went left to some flakes. I lead 2nd pitch. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. 2nd pitch to the top is a great mellow way to finish the day. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Boulder start + glass Crack. There are flakes left of the glass cracks that are easier. Traverse left after glass craxks \u00b7 4 pitches. AAI guide training. climbed twice, once as guide and once as \u201cclient\u201d \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Led pitch 1. Found it harder than Midway. Tricky start and section of polished face climbing. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead. Bouldery move off the ground, then one fun but committing 20 foot section where feet are a bit slippery and you're using a crack to the right. Followed it again on TR to clean. FUN. \u00b7 Follow. Shenanigans, couldn\u2019t find bolt anchors at top of p1, had to bail on tree around to right \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Flash. Did P2 after doing P1 of Canary. Easy and fun cruise up to top! Can't hear each other, radios needed \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Did the 5.7/5.8 corner crack instead of original zigzagging face cracks at the top of pitch 1. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. A little hard to determine what the correct start is. Kyle missed the anchors which is not hard to do. Second pitch moves well and is fairly easy.",

Veer right on a finger traverse ,pass another old piton and gain the arrete, either belay here or further up on horizontal cracks. Comes out on the north (left) side of the summit block.I have led out from the bolted anchor all the way to the summit block in one pitch, even with scant gear and long slings pretty bad rope drag.One should be a expert moss leader on this.",

Based on mountain project description, we maybe didn\u2019t do the intended pitches 2/3. Just kinda went up til we hit the summit. Nice adventure climb \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Lots of nice views and moss. Crack start was strenuous\u2014 would put it at castle rock 9+ (which I think is what the book grades this route). Lost a 0.4 due to poor placement. Second crux on p2 was heady but manageable. \u00b7 2 pitches. we rapped off the tree anchor (twin ropes). Ben led both, Katie and I followed \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. Climbed to tat anchor at tree, was not convinced there is a route through moss and dirt above \u00b7 1 pitch. Follow. tough start. get your finger jams ready. only did the first pitch. with CH \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. P1 only. aided the first 20ft. hard lead. Harold followed and cleaned. \u00b7 TR. Vince lead. Climbed next to Alex Daniel Ryan party. So cool we were all on Castle Rock multi-pitching up next to each other. Fun day, good weather! :) \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. P1 so good to bolt anchors. P2 go up-left ~10ft then slight R to 1 piton for gear anchor. P3 no line of sight w partner. Easy walk off \u00b7 4 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Missy as fuck. Grabbed a pin so I wouldn\u2019t deck :( \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Michael did 2nd pitch. Hung halfway up stem corner on 1st pitch. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Cleaned up route a bit and tapped on the pins a bit. Added new cord and rap ring to bolts by tree \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. First pitch was pretty okay. Everytime it got going, it stopped. 2nd Pitch was a mess. Rapd at Tree \u00b7 Route finding hard on first pitch. Bolted anchors to the left if you want to make it 3 pitches. Can do it in 2 though if you build an anchor. \u00b7 1 pitch. Follow. Couldn't find pitch 2, super mossy, rapped on a 70m from tree after bolted anchors \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. fun doing 2 and 3 pitch as one 200 ft. to top.",

Adds to the mental head game. \u00b7 Follow. Could probably lead, one scary move but I did it twice clean. Whole climb clean. \u00b7 TR. practiced placing trad gear for the first time, cool route with fun holds! recommend climbing earlier in the day \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Ripped gear out for the first time ever but got back on it. \u00b7 TR. Great hand jams and finger jams. Foot stemming makes it smooth to gain the bulge. My issue is gaining the footholds, as well as bad gear placement. So not ready to lead yet. \u00b7 TR. So fun can\u2019t wait to learn trad and try to lead it one day \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at the crux. Used 0.2 at the stuck cam 1/3 up, otherwise used double 0.4-0.5 (with one each before stuck cam), and one #2 at top before the lip. Quite fun though! Anchor has clips. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 take before the big pull onto the ledge at the end \u00b7 Follow. Climbed as P1 of Midway, set up P2 belay across the step off. Hung on the crux. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Placed about half nuts, half cams. Really fun and sustained route. \u00b7 Lead. super fun route! Takes great small gear. Used 2x black and blue totems. Felt kind of sporty. Great for my hand size at least, only one move where the feet felt insecure. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Start is stiff and has limited protection, but rest of climb is very good and slightest bit of overhang. \u00b7 Follow. One can lead belay up followers and link this route up with p2 and p3 of Midway with minimal rope drag by building a rope anchor around the pinnacle at the top of the route (before the traverse to the shared anchors at the top of jello tower). We belayed the last climber to the jello tower /Midway chains once we were all up and just prussik belayed ourselves over on that strand once he had built an anchor there for added safety, but the walk over isn\u2019t too bad. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 2 takes at the crux because I'm weak and scared. Holds are good & there's good variety through the climb; great climb. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. took before the bulge. Nervous about trusting the 2 .2s I had in. \u00b7 2 pitches. Meeting with the Uphill Athlete Coaching Team (Steve H. Pedro, Alexa, Martin Z, Ben M) \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. super good gear the entire way. some very small cams are ideal in order to have pro at your waist during the harder moves. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Exciting for a 5.10 leader. Chain anchor on top also serves The Nose of Sandbagged Tower (5.14b/c roughly) ;)",

Brought the #5 and made the committing moves. Could also place during the traverse. Didn't really need the #4. Drag at the end to get to Logger's Ledge was horrendous. There is an intermediate anchor if you want it. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Alex yelled up some crucial beta about a 0.75 right before you cut feet. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Super mellow with a #5. It\u2019s a juggg baby. Great exposure and movement \u00b7 Follow. This one is wild. Good gear. Quite a move to pull the roof. Fell. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. The starting anchor (after climbing 80% of P1 of Catapult) is a gear anchor, gear #2-4, can use a small/medium nut and a 0.2 in a pinch. Then used 0.4-5 on actual Bone, having one #3 for the pitch itself is nice, as is a #5. Once on top the roof it\u2019s easy and 0.4-1 gear. I think I only used singles. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Spooky loose rock on the horizonral crack beneath the roof, and the vertical crack beneath needs a #5. Otherwise suuuupser fun! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Bjorn linked the 2 5.8 approach pitches and I led the bone! Felt like a 5.6 gunks roof. \u00b7 Follow. w Harold. really fun route, take early exit right, keep #3 for anchor \u00b7 2 pitches. Follow. w Reinder. Harder than a 5.9. I'd say 5.10. Holds were good, but quite overhanging and swinging feet on top of the \"bone\" not a 5.9 move. Pumpy. Hung/fell while trying to pull the crux (pump). Pro is good. Incredible exposure. Gear anchor at start of P1 (stoner ledge), bolts 15 feet above the bone (for us end P1). Heads-up that the follower might swing far from the wall if falling at the crux \u00b7 Follow. TR followed Luke as part of multi pitch ascent of castle 05/13/23. This was scary, needed to be aided through the ledge :/ \u00b7 Lead. Led from ground. Lots of rope drag even with long slings. Stop at ledge next time. Then go from ledge, over bone & to the top on 2nd pitch. \u00b7 Follow. Swapped to this instead of the last part of catapult. Loved the exposure and high feet and huge hands. So much fun! w Olivia / LWGs \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. wow!! grosses prises, beaucoup d'air et un swing de jambe! Pour Arnaud du futur: ne pas remettre de pro dans les blocs lousses du toit \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Lead once w/ Eric several years ago. Shannon led this time. Great climb, wish we had walkie talkies \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. The aha moment was when i realized I had to (or rather, got to) cut feet. We set up a small anchor on top of the bone (there\u2019s barely room but it works) to bring up the second which made it a lot easier to manage falls/takes on the roof than it would have been from way up on logger\u2019s ledge. Hope you have walkie talkies\u2026 \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Super fun, linked with the Canapult pitch which was really great but shoulda extended the last piece. Rope drag was a lot. #2 in the roof was great beta. Katie was hella spooked on the follow. Sick belay ledge \u00b7 Lead. took a few times, shoulda just gone for it move wasn't too bad. .75 in horizontal above roof seemed good. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. wowza! theres a bomber Purple totem right before committing to \"the move\" around the roof. w/TJ \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Love the movement on this pitch! Still Don't need a 5. \u00b7 get to roof, wide stem with left foot/drop knee for small placements in roof.",

With Aidan after ecc. Fun! I was scared but it wasn\u2019t so bad. Forgot my chalk bag. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Got myself into a very awkward stance at second roof. Very sick route! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Single rack 0.2-3, nuts. Doubles (3, 0.3, 0.4) 8 Alpine draws. 60m rope. P1 has a bolted anchor. P2 is a vision quest, potential short rope terrain. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Burly burly burly. Hung at the second roof before pulling left. Not really a good rest anywhere so milk if ya find it. First roof protected w tipped out 4 and .2, black totem might be better? Extend more lower if it won\u2019t mean a deck? Second roof - #3 before left, #1 roof, .4roof(place far left to minimize crack eating rope, black totem at bulge of roof to keep rope out, .2 then gets you onto roof. Good hold out left, feet are smears but they\u2019re good. Punch it and perfect #2 crack to rest on. .3/4pffset protected beached whale exit well \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Bjorn. Super fun. Would do again. Rope got stuck-ish after pulling the last lip. Maybe next time I\u2019ll put a nut there or something to keep the rope from jamming. \u00b7 Follow. One slip after first roof (1st crux) September 2023 side pull crack to right helps \u00b7 3 pitches. Follow. First pitch is hard asf. Such a good climb. Quality. This might be one of the best climbs I\u2019ve ever done at the grade. This thing was so fun and constantly engaging. \u00b7 so fun, protectable throughout, straddle for rest before second roof. finger crack crux - where? found lots of places for 3s and .4. hoot \u00b7 Follow. A grueling alternative to the 10 minute walk up the trail to Logger's Ledge \u00b7 Follow. I lead through the first roof, after i was too pumped. Matt finished the climb for me \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. big moves made for frightening lead. first roof felt most difficult for me, 2nd was still a challenge. rested/hung in a handful of places. felt harder than 10b but maybe just nature of the route \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. hung on 2nd roof, just need to get over an knee bar tho. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. looked at pics on mt. project that I think helped w beta so not onsight. very fun \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Flash. sooo good!! led after cleaning TJs send. epic route. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. So hungover leading this shit, and got the rope mega stuck coming out the second roof \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Followed Jeremy on this several years ago. Lead this today and it was so much fun. Smiling the whole way! \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Flash. Had a little bit of beta pre attempt. Super rad!!!",

Did the 2 pitches separately on different days. 1 pitch was a redpoint since I followed it the first time. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Led p1. Getting over the roof was tough but protectable the whole way through \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Led the first pitch, Billy led the second. Skipped the fault. Spicy first lead of the day but did it \u00b7 Lead. Led pitch 1. Chris T led pitch 2. Hornets still on the Fault, had to traverse in to the base of Catapult from the west. \u00b7 3 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Led mossy pitch to get to P1 + p1, some of P2. Had to break it up due to forgetting radios + road noise \u00b7 3 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Scrambled to the base of brass balls then pitched out the rest to the belay on the ledge below the crack. Super fun climb! Kinda odd belays. Having 2x 3s and a 4 was nice \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Aaron led p1 to ledge, then I topped out. Next time: can pass chains above chimney to better belay spot; option to climb past smoker\u2019s ledge for a belay spot that doesn\u2019t require the traverse onto the ledge; find better top out anchor than a dead\u2019ish tree. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Really fun movement through both moves! Look for feet out left. Used one nut (yellow offset), doubles in .4-3, except for. 75s which I didn't place in this pitch. Black totem was lovely for protecting the last move before the belay ledge of pitch 1. The right facing corner on pitch one after the second roof is lovely!! Climb this and enjoy, then build your belay. Last pitch is moss/choss romping. \u00b7 Follow. Super fun line. Maybe haul packs for the Fault as it's kind of a pita. Really fun climbing 5.8 roofs. Doubles (0.3-3) 10 Alpines 60m \u00b7 Follow. Fell following it, really struggled at the roof crux. I'll get it some day. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Great route to push your grade. I found it hard but lots of great gear along the way to sit and rest. Last pitch makes an exciting solo if you\u2019re a confident climber. \u00b7 Follow. Followed on pitch 1 (the 5.8 part) and led the second pitch (low-fifth) to Logger's Ledge \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 2 takes. One at the crux and 1 right after the optional ledge. \u00b7 3 pitches. Follow. Climbed in 3 pitches from the bottom of the fault. Hung on P2. \u00b7 Follow. Seemed harder and scarier than Outerspace. Will be a great lead for me hopefully soon. \u00b7 3 pitches. Lead / Flash. Led first 2, friend led scramble to top. Fantastic climb. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. solid climbing all the way through. the reach past the mantle was tricky to trust my high left foot but otherwise felt confident to pull the roof, up and over for a nice number 3 C4 placement. the last section of P1 was surprising to see a great featured fracture in the corner. great climbing all the way through. P2 was just a cheeky low fifth but overall comfortable and easy. Gear anchor on top ** \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead. With Ryan. Linked catapult and fault...then into the Bone from the ledge. \u00b7 Follow. sarah led the 1st pitch and I led the scramble to the top. very fun! \u00b7 led P1. Fun climbing, a bit physical but good feet most of the route. Kelly led the fault (weird/hollow pro) and P2 of the catapult. \u00b7 1 pitch. Follow. w Reinder. Only P1 as then did The Bone. Bolts at the end of Fault (start of Catapult P1), Gear anchor on stoner ledge to the right under The Bone (but if continuing to P2, continue further up and left of stoner ledge to end P1 with gear anchor). 2nd time following. It indeed has good protection - might lead next time.... hate the missing feet placements in the crux. Maybe 5.8+ \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. One take at the crux and I hate myself for it, could of had it. Pitch 1 is great, excellent 5.8 trad in a cool setting. Pitch 2 felt like a scramble with just a few scattered moves. Only placed three or four pieces on P2. Placed a lot more on P1. \u00b7 Lead. Led pitch 1. A0 one move over the overhang. Andrea led pitch 2. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Flash. Leading this second time, crux was a bit harder this time with softer shoes. \u00b7 3 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. simul'd the fault/catapult linkup with Chris in one long pitch. So fun \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Grayson led the hero pitch, I led the easy exit pitch. Good to get back on the sharp end \u00b7 3 pitches. Solo. Onsight, lead rope solo. 1st pitch of fault into catapult pitches. Surprisingly enjoyable \u00b7 Lead. Led P1 and was surprised at the exposure, def not the chill 5.8 I was expecting! I believe castlerock to be a bit stiff. The climb was really fun and exciting, but I was definitely a little puckered in the middle section. Top crack was awesome! Used almost an entire double rack between the pitch and gear anchor. P2 was dirty and unremarkable \u00b7 Follow. With JV and Han. Jared led lower, I led upper. Such a sick route! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Led P1 to the start of the Bone. Juggy and steep, good stuff! \u00b7 Follow. Jessica wanted to lead Catapult, and led it clean! I led the meh 3rd pitch. \u00b7 Follow. TR followed the first and third pitches of this route in an ascent of Castlerock. Replaced 2nd pitch with the bone. 05/13/23 \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. swung leads with Chris. super sick 1st pitch. forgettable gardening 2nd pitch \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Haley lead the pitch 1; the chimney pitch. Max lead pitch 2; the money pitch. Such an amazingly fun pitch. I\u2019d definitely feel comfortable leading it next time- it\u2019s definitely more if a sporty climb/crux. Haley lead the last easy pitch - though easy, I\u2019d personally not want to do it without any protection. \u00b7 Follow. Fell on the crux, but made it through second try. Awesome and hard. w Olivia / LWGs \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Great after work route! Hit this with Brian and started from the Fault. I led pitch 2 which was super fun. Very exposed feeling but lots of protection options. Beware of a few larger loose blocks towards the top of pitch 2. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Did this with Shannon. Take the left path at the parking lot. Then when you get to the log on the ground in the notch. Take the sharp right path to get to base of route with chains \u00b7 Lead. With Carlos! Dropped my .5 but we found it at the base. Classic! \u00b7 3 pitches. Follow. cool climb, really tricky bulge on 2nd pitch. first pitch isn't listed on MP \u00b7 Lead. With Cody. Stormy with gnarly clouds, thundershower/downpour while leading 5.8 pitch and windy. Cody cruised the 5.8 \u00b7 Follow. Followed David. Wow the crux section is amazing. If I ever come back I need to do this again! The crux is totally G \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Climbed w/ Jesse Reinking. I led both pitches and combined into 1 pitch. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Climbed w/ Eric some number of years ago. Not sure when exactly",

Weird Saturday night \u00b7 Lead. Got up to the tree and got attacked by bees and had to bail \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Led chimney to chains. We both got stung by wasps near the chimney tree; me while trying to place a cam, Aaron while trying to clean it. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Tricky. Haul your packs. Got a .5 down low and a 1 and black totem before making the roofy move. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Did it to link up Catapult and Midway as a fun multi-pitch climb. I did take a lead fall in the chimney \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. .2, 3.5, sling, .4, .75, 1, 3, 1, .5 Cool chimney! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. difficult to protect the bottom below the tree since some of the wider sections of crack are hollow sounding, had to relearn chimney climbing :P but above the tree there are great pieces to protect in the overhung Boulder lodged in the top of the chimney. fun but struggled \u00b7 TR. all the flakes inside take gear well, but sound kind of hollow. Kelly slung the tree too, probably solid? not a worthwhile climb on its own \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. w Reinder. Did it again this time leading. Yes looks harder than a 5.6 and it is runout below, before reaching the tree. Fortunately I had a #4 that fit at the beginning of the chimney. Bolts at end of P1. Could consider bringing a #5 as well next time \u00b7 Follow. w Paul - then headed to Catapult. Felt a bit harder than 5.6 - but maybe because was first route of the day and a very early start \u00b7 TR. Followed Jed on this route and we linked it to catapult. Chimney was easy to get stuck in especially with a backpack. \u00b7 4 pitches. Follow. Climbed this route to get to Catapult. Fun chimney but it was a little tricky at the bottom while carrying the backpack! \u00b7 Lead. Ugh, I don't love chimneys, but it's worth it to get to the good stuff on Catapult \u00b7 Follow. Amelia + backpack difficult in chimney. Ended up dragging backpack on haul loop. Next time, try clipping to right hip. \u00b7 Follow. TR follow as first pitch of multi pitch ascent of castle with Luke on 05/13/23 \u00b7 4 pitches. first pitch for the second time now (first time to access catapult). this time, we tried to climb the \"5.8 roof\" on the right side of the crag, but couldn't find it after quite a bit of searching and downclimbing. everything was very dirty over there. we ended up in this sandy, horrible corner, and decided to just trot off to the right. \u00b7 Lead. With Cody. On our way to Catapult and then the top. 6p in 2.5hr. \u00b7 Follow. Followed David (I was a mock client for him). A great climb, but my chimney game is weak and it didn\u2019t help that I had an oversized pack on \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. with Lindsey and Megan. a little wet. very fun. linked into catapult \u00b7 3 pitches. Lead. Unable to finish using beta from comments, we followed the ledge right on a highly vegetate pitch that is almost unclimbable. From there going up looked possible but would be unable to protect a slab pitch due to moss, it would involve some sort of potential fun roof pitch. Instead we took the obvious clack system up catapult which felt 5.9 to me, the top is a gear anchor and a solid belay ledge. There are no rap rings but there is nylon webbing that had been used to rap off unknown where it leads to. Final pitch is fun flowy 5.5 climbing to base of Midway. \u00b7 Lead. Gear is a bit thin until you get to the tree and properly in the chimney. Follower didn\u2019t love having a pack lol \u00b7 Follow. I\u2019ve lead before. James lead today so I could lead Pitch 1 of catapult. \u00b7 Follow. Fede\u2019s lead, he had a hard time but I cruised up, mostly stemming. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Definitely proved I need to work on my chimney technique, got kinda gripped. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Mountain Madness ACC 08/15 - 08/22 Guide: Zach Anderson Clients: Shawn and Nick \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Interesting enough, I guess. A bit awkward, even without a pack. I wouldn't repeat this for itself, but definitely would to get to Catapult. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Julia followed with a backpack which sounded awful since I had trouble squeezing through without one \u00b7 Lead. Did the first chimney pitch to get to the base of Catapult. Was v grateful for the black totem in a small horizontal crack in the chimney. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. fun chimney-esque climb with M...did with Catapult to get to Loggers Ledge",
