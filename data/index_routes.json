You will see a large white clean cliff through the trees just after the spur heading to the top of the upper wall and after passing \"One Bobcat Rock\" Most climbers will recognize the roofs and blocky gully which marks the eastern edge of the cliff band touching the UTW trail just before the last steep section leading to Davis Holland. You will see a rough trail left through a large patch of ferns approaching a very inspiring roof system. This is the Lighthouse.",

Although the name is Upstate New York, the climbing is more a British gritstone experience. With each climb, the protection is bomber, but PRECISE. The movement is sequential with the standard Index Party Tricks. The rock is course and grippy. Head-Pointing is the game at this wall.  The Westward most area in the Shady Lane Shady Lines (hot day shady climbing areas).These climbs are all easily TR’d and graded with the assumption that the climber will be previewing the path and be challenged at the grade (as with the FA team). Ground Up or On-Sight ascents of any of the pitches on this wall will receive 25 extra bonus points and 2 climbing grade bumps from the Index/Gunks Climbing Committee on Bonus Grades and Points. Regardless, this wall is a Top-Rope party you should invite your friends to and lead the climbs when you have them dialed.",
    "area_getting_there": "Location: The Gunks can be accessed most easily by going to Shady Lane West, then continuing about 4 minutes west along the trail. When you get to the giant roofs(Illusion Wall), use the trail going downhill to the base of the cliff. To set up a TR, continue past the roofs along the cliff line about 100 feet and follow the trail left to the fixed line at the top. The anchors are all just below the top lip of the wall.The cliff is actually only 100 feet from the UTW Top trail and when you’re done climbing here, just head directly away from the wall down to the main trail. When you come back for more, you may find this way a little quicker.",

This is a nice companion route to the nearby 5.8 Asterisk (a very short walk across the Diamond Gully away) and its neighbor the Ave P1. When combined with its neighbors, this is probably the best combination of 5.8s in Index.The line essentially follows the crack system next to the via ferrata for Madsen's Ledge. You can start with the 5.6 wide crack of Uptown High Rise or scramble around it and start at the base of the via ferrata.Additional cleaning may be needed given the low angle. A harder second pitch is partly scrubbed for anyone who wants to finish it.",

Pitch has three new protection bolts and goes free at 5.12 something.Pitch 2 (A2 F) - climb the short, low angle, thin crack with many fixed copperheads, have fun slinging the chickenhead.Note: P2 is now fully bolted with the old pins and copperheads removed.

You can now access some excellent 5.10 climbing on Rise and Fall and Green Drag-on without having to climb 5.12. The pitches listed below can be combined in a variety of ways depending on what you are looking for.Pitches five and six are bouldery and have really fun movement. Big thanks to Alex and Cody for playing around on this route with me!Pitch 1 - 5.9 - 90 ftClimb the 5.9 start of Davis-Holland with fun jams and fingerlocks. This pitch is sometimes wet. Belay at two bolts on a nice ledge.Pitch 2 - 5.10a - 100 ftContinue up Davis-Holland, stellar fingers and thin hands in a corner. To a two bolt anchor on a sloping ledge.With a few back cleaning shenanigans the 2nd pitch of Davis-Holland can be combined with the next pitch which yields an amazing 55m pitch of 5.10 climbing.Pitch 3 - 5.10c - 100 feet - 8 BoltsFrom the belay look up and right for a lone bolt with a black painted hanger. Undercling across the roof, per the right variation of the Davis-Holland, and then step right to a perfect jug under the bolt. Execute a short trickey section which yields a horizontal (#2 camalot) and some moderate face climbing to get onto the second pitch of Rise and Fall. Skip the belay out right and clip another black painted bolt up and to the left.Follow amazing crystal edges up a dike passed 6 spaced bolts. This is the second pitch of Rise and Fall. The crux comes at the end getting past two different roofs. Belay at a good stance with three bolts.Pitch 4 - 5.10d - 75 feet - 2 boltsStart up Rise and Fall passing one bolt until you reach a finger crack. Get some gear and step right below a bolt that is on Green Drag-on. Clip this and continue up to a two bolt anchor under a roof. (This is the end of pitch 3 of Green Drag-on).Clip the anchor for pro and make a hard move to get established in the steep crack that exits the right side of the roof. Sustained 5.10 crack climbing leads to a stance on the left with two bolts. This anchor is not setup for rappel, so if you want to bail you need to aid up and left on Green Drag-on or climb the next pitch and rappel Town Crier. It is possible to split this into two 40 foot pitches but there is no reason to do so and the P3 anchor on Green Drag-on is fully hanging and an awful place to belay.Pitch 5 - 5.11c/d - 40 feet - 4 boltsClimb up the corner with some thin gear to a good jug. Clip a shiny bolt out right. (The bolts above and to the left are for Green Drag-on) A balancy section leads to a tenuous second clip. There are holds, if you look in the right places! Keep working right with a powerful section past the third bolt. Clip the final bolt and step right to the three bolt anchor on Town Crier.Pitch 6 - 5.11d - 105 feet - 2 bolts.Start up the flare on Town Crier and clip a few pins that can be backed up with thin gear. Execute a sweet layback sequence (crux) to get established on a flexy flake. Crank past the flake, 2 bolts protect, and then immediately start traversing left on an obvious horizontal crack. (Going up further is the 5.12+ crux pitch of Town Crier)Twenty feet of sweet jugs bring you back to the Green Drag-on. Follow the final 50 feet of 5.10 crack climbing to an anchor on a busy ledge.The #3 is useful for the last pitch but everything else above #.75 is not necessary for the last two pitches.",
        "route_location": "This route starts on the Davis-Holland and finishes on Green Drag-on.There are many ways to rappel. I suggest going down Green Drag-on and then swinging left to Rise and Fall  (clipping a bolt as a directional helps).

First pitch was wet (as advertised), but the finger locks are bomber so the water was more of a novelty than a problem.  Second pitch is sweet fingers to tight hands - suprisingly pumpy and sustained for the grade.   I brought three green Camalots (#0.75) and placed them all, and probably could have placed more - the crack is very consistent in that width and #1 Camalots didn't go in.   Third pitch (we did the single bolt friction option out left) was varied, suspenseful, and fun.  Lots of small nuts protect the business portion of this pitch.   Each pitch was about 30-35m.  We didn't have time for Lovin Arms, and rappelled straight down in 2 rappels (double rope). A conservative rack for this climb would be nuts (including thin), double set of cams from fingers to #3 Camalot, with 1 or 2 extra green Camalots for good measure. Jun 8, 2007",

Led pitch 2: layback problems again. Put the piece and climb through the crux dude....good stemming, not awesome rests · Lead / Onsight. So freakin fun!! Led the last pitch, intriguing and techy movement! Loved! · Lead / Onsight. Led pitch 3. Wild sequence of committing moves. Pitch 2 felt index 10b to me, not sure about 10a(guide book rating seems on point), I guess its sustained 10a so felt 10b to me. · Lead p1. Really enjoyed the other 2 pitches. P2 is sustained. More like 10b. Aided through p3 crux. Can see why this is classic · Lead / Fell/Hung. With Culver, I led P1. Did the left variation start for P3. · Lead. Climbed with Andreea and her friend Eric, led P1-P3 and followed P2, all clean. .2 and ball nuts were nice to have, as well as 4 .75. Still a very fun climb! · 6 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Full DHLA. Led evens. Thought P2 would be hard with extended section of greens, but somehow got pretty good hand jams? did my hands shrink? P3 crux was cleaning a nut without taking · Fell on P3. After the roof go left. The crux takes purple and green C3s, black alien, small brassies. · Lead. led p1. p2, 5 0.75s is super nice. p3, brass nuts and a 5 for the move right off the anchor is very nice. · 2 pitches. Follow. Didn't fall on first pitch, but fell a bunch on second, finished it tho · Lead / Onsight. Awesome. With Jess, and Maple watched. Met Colt and Oscar. A little hot and sweaty on p2 · Lead. Led 1,2. Follow p3. 3x.75 nice to have. Doubles to #3 camalot. Offset brass for p3 crux · Lead / Onsight. Swapped leads w/Ryan. Good route through LA. Gear is as listed: singles .1-3, doubles .5-2, (4) .75. Nuts, slings for sure, couple sport draws. Any length rope if you’re planning to walk off. · Follow. P3: Right hand mental on the crimp, left foot smear on the lower crack, left hand reach for the top crack. HIGH right foot, match with hand, stem up · Lead / Fell/Hung. Place a thin nut below the crux, then go. Don’t place it in the high hold. · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Attempted to onsight P3. Took at crux, figured it out. · Lead. Lead p1 and p2 clean, fell at the crux on p3. Need to build up the head game for small gear again but very fun day out! · Lead / Flash. sent p2, followed the rest. graywolf and Regan, party of 3 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led p1,2 as part of DH/LA. Hung on p2 cuz pumped and out of shape! Very fun though. P3 is a one move wonder with good small gear and a fun roof to start. P1 not trivial! · Lead. Super fun. Pitch 2 was fun layback moves. Pitch 3 had one cruxy move. Fun climb · Lead / Onsight. Stoked on this. With Bjorn. He led 1st pitch and I the 2nd and 3rd. This after 4 pitches on main wall, including Sagittarius! Good day. 2nd pitch was great. Placed 4 .75s. 3rd pitch was cool. It was fun placing brassies for the crux moves. Didn’t have time for lovin arms so we sat at the top of this and had a sandwich while watching the sunset. Rapped down the 3rd pitch to retrieve a stuck .3. From top of 2nd pitch I rapped down a bit and found a shiny new anchor on the face to the left, then one more rap to the base. · Lead. Climbed with Logan lead P3. Great climb! I found pitch 3 to be delicate and a bit heady given the crux is over micro gear but it goes! I found the roof to be pretty chill. · Lead / Onsight. Sent with John. Lead first two, he took thin fingers. Idk why people say to take a #4, nowhere to place it at the crux or roof. · Lead / Redpoint. Fun day. Rained while leading P3 crux. Wet slab, ha ha! · Lead / Redpoint. Led pitches 1 and 3; followed 2 clean though it’s still hard as fuck for me. · Led p1, gen p2 and Katie p3. P2 felt like crux, 3-4 .75s. Red and yellow z4 for final pitch, as well as a #4 · So fun. 3-4 green cams helpful for pitch 2. Pitch 3 nice to have .1 cam. · 5 pitches. TR. follow p1, lead p2, tr lap p2 x2, tr lap p1 x1 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell trying to figure out P3 crux. Protected well with small nuts w/o blocking the holds. Tried to double gaston and then high foot. Got through the crux by leaning right onto the side pulls. Start of P3 was spicy. Didn’t want to place gear in the roof for fear of drag but the fall would’ve been onto the belayer then onto the slab. · Lead / Onsight. Jake P1,3. Lau P2. 5-star climbing. Did unprotected roof on 3. 2 is sustained but all there. Lovely time. · Follow. hard, think I hung at least once on p1, many hangs p2, clean p3, p3 probably my favorite, fun roof not as hard as it seems and some interesting delicate exposed face moves at the end. · Lead / Onsight. lead 5.9. boulder problems on lead on pitch 3 is a nope for me, for now · Lead / Onsight. Fun and engaging route! The second pitch whilst fun, was the complete wrong size for my hands. It was either thin tips or somewhat insecure paddles which made it feel quite hard in sections. The “crux pitch” I actually didn’t find that bad. Despite my dislike of roofs I was able to pull through it pretty easily. A few confidence inspiring RP nut placements at the crux made the moves feel not too hard as I soon discovers plenty of hand and foot holds to use at my disposal. Planned to do the next 3 pitches of Lovin arms but decided to bail due to the heat and our rapidly decreasing supply of liquid. Hope to finish the link up some other day! · Lead. Led P2 and Cam P1 and P3 P2 felt hard and I took a few time. I had no issue on P3 and I think I could lead it · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led 1 and 3. Fell at the crux. Apparently I could have just reached the good edge instead of turning it into a v4 boulder · Lead / Redpoint. Foot slipped while cleaning #4 and I never waited rope but did grab the cam which was already in hand to stay on. Downclimbed and touched anchor and restarted pitch on follow and sent · Lead / Fell/Hung. w/ Noah! I lead evens he lead odds I wanted more .75s for p.2. Salamander or lizard sighting IN THE CRACK on P.2. I thought it was a snake at fist and nearly punted off LOL! God what. a. good. CLIMB. Noah cruised p.3 super cool crux at the top (reachy!) · Lead / Redpoint. Odd pitches with Cindy and Jeff and Jamie S were behind us · Lead. standard rack with one #3. pitch 2 is varied enough that doubles 0.75 is adequate. don't need #5 for start of p3. finger piece under roof with double length sling and then pull move around roof to right. · Lead / Onsight. Climbed on a hot day with Lura. Only had two .75s and was alright. P2 seemed the hardest. · Lead / Fell/Hung. led pitch 2 and 3, one fall at the p3 crux. rad!! · Lead / Fell/Hung. took at a 1 in the sun, bailed at pitch 2 · Lead / Flash. P2 was super fun! And someone else got photos of me on it! Only had two 0.75’s and it was fine. Brought 0.2-4 with double 0.3-2 and nuts, that worked well. P1 (29m) was def awkward. P2 (32m) was a bit easier than expected, the tough corner crack is pretty short. P3 (34m) roof was easy, but then the crux was tricky. Comms were difficult, bring radios next time. Rapped with 60m in 3 raps, 27m straight down, then 28m plus swinging to one climbers left, then ~22m to ground · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on pitch 2, only brought 2x .75 and spent too much time fiddling with gear · Follow. With Bjorn, I lead pitch 1. Pitch 2 could use 4 .75 cams. Don’t climb in the sun · Lead / Redpoint. Lead p1 and p3. P1 wet, some c0. P3 felt easy today · 2 pitches. Follow. GA led, both pitches take good gear, thin hands on P2 feels insecure · Lead / Onsight. Onsight pitch 1 & 2. Pulled on a piece thru the crux. Went back and climbed it clean. · 6 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Fun fun. Hung leading p2 but followed the rest through full DHLA clean. Lovely. 70m rope for raps was groovy. · 4 pitches. Incredible! Os all pitches, lil too hot to go all the way up lovin arms:( · Lead / Onsight. Led 1/2 Need good small nuts for pitch 3 fingers in middle"

There was a great deal of excitement despite the need for a large amount of scrubbing and excavation of moss.This pitch starts on the Aid route Abraxas but then branches into new free climbable terrain above a second roof at a smattering of knobs.Randy's original free variation, now dubbed \"The Beast That Hath Two Backs\",  follows a pair of dikes on the right past three bolts which I found to be unreasonably difficult. To find the Gnostic Diversion instead clip the first bolt and balance up the slab on the left.  Once a second bolt is reached execute a difficult rightward boulder problem to rejoin the dikes.

There is a small stance there and a single bolt that can be backed up with a #1 camelot ( or maybe #2... its been awhile).  This makes working and sending the 12c pitch a lot easier on the climber and the belayer.  Not sure why Justin didn't do it this way.  its much more logical.

Follow the hand crack up into a mossy chimney that presents many options. A two-bolt anchor lies on the left side of the chimney on top of a small ledge.P2: 5.10a, 5.10c A0, or 5.11c, depending on how you go - The original route, with a single bolt for aid if you traverse right from the anchors. Pulling on a sling brings you to a crack system; these moves go free at 5.11c.The more common way is to continue up the chimney for about 20 feet then follow a crack on a ramp that goes down and right to a shallow corner. Done this way the pitch is overall 5.10a.Either way, from this point continue up a crack in a small corner until some large solid holds become available, then rightward and upward to a mantle onto a large ledge and the anchors.P3: From the anchors climb up the quartz-like face, past one bolt, to some cracks that will take gear. Hand and footholds are numerous but many are downsloping. Continue directly upward to the anchors, or bail out leftward into the pine trees. This pitch probably deserves an R rating.For descent, you may rappel the route with 2 60m ropes, use one of many rappel options to climber's left, or walk off easily. To find the trail, go leftward until you find the dirt road, follow it until you reach a steel and cable barricade, and go left.

If you only have a 60 meter rope, there is a decent way to rap off the upper town wall using both the Heaven's Gate and Golden Road Anchors: -Walk climbers left over to the top of Heaven's Gate (The anchors are a little hard to find, but but it is the second bolt line from climbers left of the main chimney/corner; the anchors are down one ledge, past a small tree, then anchors are below this ledge/tree on another ledge at the edge of the wall). -Rappel straight down 30 meters to next bolted anchors on Heaven's Gate (you will be at the ends of your rope). -Rappel down 30 meters to the very ends of your rope and pull/walk yourself ~30' over to the anchors on Golden Road (the anchors are not very visible until you are near the ends of your rope, and you will be at the last 2-3 feet of your rope to reach the anchors; there is little to no rope abrasion when pulling/walking yourself over if you position your rope properly). -Rappel to next anchors on Golden Road. -Rappel <30 meters to a ledge 15 feet off the ground (ropes will be out of sight down an overhang). -Scramble down off of the ledge after pulling your rope.

Lead / Fell/Hung. One hung crux pitch. Bailed out right on last pitch for sketch factor. · Lead / Fell/Hung. w/ Noah. I lead odds. I thought the first part off the deck was spicy. I took to get my head on straight to pull through. Was rather dirty to start but still fabulous climbing and cleaned up. Noah lead 10a version of the 2nd pitch which was really fun. The top pitch was committing but only 5.9 imo. Clip the bolt ~15 feet up, cam placed near the bush, pink tricam, .2, .3? then run out to the top. Top out was slopy and lichen covered. eek. pulled on the tree to pull over · Lead / Onsight. Not as loose as people say. Everything felt pretty solid. Led P2 = P5 for DHLA. Took the easy way. Go back for .11c way - not much but 3 finger drag out right and pop up to crack looks to be the way based off rappel. Also check out STP in the future · Lead / Onsight. Not nearly as good as the first three pitches. Questionable rock and a bit run out on p5 and p6. Worth it to top out, but nothing special. P4 was the crux of the whole route 10c. · Lead / Fell/Hung.

Crazy hot afternoon. Baked in the sun. Led P1 & P3. Hung on P1 thin section. · Lead / Onsight. Led all pitches, with Lauren. Super fun chimney, starting P1 was very tricky but fun. Did the 10a chimney on P2. Got off route right of end of P3, definitely more like 10c end. · Lead / Onsight. DHLA w Con. I have no idea why someone would think it’s lesser quality than DH. It’s less splittter but the movement is just as good. All pitches are amazing stellar day · Lead. Lead 2, 4, 6. Eric lead 1, 3, 5. Super classic line. Great position and movement to get to top of upper wall. · Lead / Onsight. Led 5, Kurt 4 and 6. free variation felt easy but fun. Epic · I would recommend 5.10 A0 variation on Pitch 2. There is a chain on the bolt, and you climb up past a diagonal crack (can place bomber piece) to the left facing corner. it was a little dirty, but will clean up nicely if more people go this way. · Follow. First run up this since my big fall. A wonderful adventure and much less eventful than some of my past ascents. Every pitch has at least one tricky section which keeps you on your toes. · Lead. P1 is legit! Went the wrong way to the chain this time, oops! Quality stuff! (NZ) · Lead / Fell/Hung. I led p1, which was soaked. Hand jamming wet, slimy cracks works surprisingly well. I hung only to assess the situation. The climbing isn’t all that hard. We didn’t try p2&3 b/c of the wetness. · 1 pitch. Follow. Followed just the P1 chimney, then bailed since it was getting dark. Chimney was soaking wet and terrifying. Would be far easier when dry. · Lead. With Kyle sears. Led evens. P4 v awkward for me, thrashed the whole way up. P5 super fun! P6 5.9 R sport, I bailed left and out, placing 2 pieces of gear · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at the start of the first pitch. Was awkward and I did not know where to go. Felt harder the any pitch in Davis Holland. Not even close to as good as the bottom three pitches · Lead / Onsight. Continued from Davis-Holland. Fun! Glad we did the last pitch! (MBk)"

        "route_description": "Do you remember the feeling of leading Princely Ambitions for the first time as a newbie and wish you could re-create that as a more experienced climber? Well then boy do I have the right route for you. This route follows the first 2.5 pitches of Uptown High Rise before splitting off right before the 5.11 crux on two bolts of 5.7 to finish on a few fun moves of 5.9 reminiscent of Princely Ambitions. Doing the route this way keeps it at a fun moderate 5.10d with ~250 of sustained quality climbing. and one easy rappel back to Madsen's. The first two pitches can be easily top roped by following the Via Ferrata to the top of Madsen's Ledge.Pitch 1 (5.7, ~40 ft): Climb up the short fist/arm crack. Almost every move can be protected with a #3 or #4 (two 4s are nice to have if at your limit). Belay at the bolt above the crack, at the base of the corner, on gear, or sling the Via Ferrata to make an anchor near the corner (probably easiest). This pitch can be easily skipped by following the hand lines to the base of the Via Ferrata.Pitch 2 (5.10+, ~130 ft): Climb up the long obvious corner through 18 bolts to Madsen's Ledge - don't forget two for the anchor. This pitch is long, sustained, and harder than it looks, but features several great rests to plan your moves out. If you're running out of draws at the end, it should be easy to back clean a couple at the top.Pitch 3 (5.10+, ~100 ft): Move the belay ~20 ft left on Madsen's Ledge to the base of a short steep corner crack. Place a cam and climb up the crack (#4 and 0.5 useful) then make an exciting move up onto the ledge (scary but safe with an attentive belay).

        "route_description": "Shrouded in mystery until recently, an ominous description in an older guidebook makes this route sound impossible and terrifying. In reality, the route merely suffers from a well-known Index paradox: like most long Upper Town Wall free routes, despite the fact that Rise and Fall is amazing and was established in the 90's at a relatively modest grade, it saw few (if any?) subsequent ascents until the summer of 2010. With more traffic, the climb has been rediscovered as a classic. The alleged runout section on the 5.10- second pitch isn't runout at all; it seems bolts may have been added at some point in the past, or perhaps the information was suspect to begin with. Appropriately, the climb was named after an incident involving one of the first ascentionists and an unfortunate rappel off the ends of his ropes while descending the route. Miraculously, he limped away from the fifty foot ground fall and subsequent tumble with a mere broken ankle (and maybe a few ribs; story can be found in old Climbing or Rock and Ice magazine)! Anyway, here are the pitch descriptions:(Approach via Green Dragon or Davis Holland)P1: Climb the corner that comprises the second pitch of Green Dragon past four bolts before moving left onto a face. Traverse left with difficulty, then up a quartzite dike that leads to crux passing a roof. Liebacking and face climbing on the continuing dike leads to an anchor (.12a/b)P2: Airy climbing up a dike leads past a roof and some really cool rock to another belay atop a small ledge (.10a). A short pitch, but fun and interesting.P3: A fairly short pitch that packs a wicked punch; consensus is that this may actually be the crux of the climb. From the belay, climb right and up more quartz holds and some knobs in a corner to a crack lieback. Climb the roof above the lieback via edges and pull over onto a slab with a really tough and tenuous mantle. Get your magic toes ready and pull off another improbable mantle-like move and a few really thin slab moves before the difficulty relents and a belay is reached (.11d++).P4: Climb a long and varied slab with some wild pockets (even a monodoigt or two!), roofs, bulges and a couple of thin crux sections (.11c).P5: Climb overhanging, blocky rock to an anchor below the top of the Upper Town Wall (.10b). Loose in places; one of the bolts is in a hanging three or four ton block stack that vibrated when I sounded it out, so use caution. There is natural gear near the bolt if attaching yourself to it makes you nervous. Short pitch.Either do another twenty feet of climbing to reach the very top or, more prudently, rappel the route.",
        "route_location": "Approach the route via Davis Holland P1 (a fun 5.9 varied hand crack and fourth class ledges) or via Green Drag-on P1 (a really cool 5.11- varied finger crack and fourth class ledges). Bring nuts for the finger crack option. Belay beneath a large right-facing corner with some bolts and a flake at the start. The approach pitches are a bit to the left of where the trail meets the Upper Town Wall.Rappel with a single rope. 60m is probably adequate, but I think a 70m reduced our rappels by one or two.",
        "route_protection": "Mostly bolts, but gear is required on the approach pitch and some finger-sized cams are crucial for a safe experience on the rest of the climb. Aside from the first pitch, I used one small cam on each of the pitches except the second (5.10a) pitch. A singles rack from small to .5 Camalot size will provide good options for the placements. 16 draws, including some runners, were more than enough for us. For either of the approach pitches, hand sized pieces and a good selection of stoppers will supplement the smaller cams nicely. Doubles in finger size cams useful for the 5.11a option.All the anchors are chain equipped, have at least two bolts and are in good shape.",

P2 follow flash. P3 OS but nearly cruxed out standing up to clip the chains. P4 clean follow after multiple falls (touched the prior belay chains after each fall). P5 had to pull through the crux (end) due to fading light after nearly making the most wild slab moves I’ve ever done almost work by going high above the bolts before stepping down onto a knob. Letty found much better beta and did the moves by stepping down at the hole and staying low - try that next time. Rapped after P5 because we ran out of light.

This is the crux pitch but only if you skipped the first pitch by climbing in from Town Crier or Green Drag-On. 80'P3 (5.9+): Steep crack climbing leads to a large ledge (Smokeout Ledge). Gear to #3 camalot. 45'.P4 (5.10 A0 or \"hard 5.11d\", AKA .12b/c): A few A0 bolt pulls over a blank bulge access very interesting face climbing in a large band of diorite-like rock which end in a semi-hanging belay at a stance. 90'. Alternately, a free variation (.12c) starts to the right of the bolt ladder, crossing it at its 2nd or 3rd bolt. A crux down low leads to flat edges and a poor stance. A friction crux requiring some serious granite sorcery climbs out of a left arching corner and leads to easier climbing on the diorite-like rock above, rejoining the regular Swim route at the anchor.P5 (.11): This and the next pitch share the same thin and technical face climbing. They both are solid 5.11.P6 (.11): See previous pitch. This one may be a touch harder.P7 (5.9+): Bolted climbing up quartzite goes to the top of the wall. A small amount of natural gear may be required on this pitch.",

Short pitches and an easy descent (only one 60m rope required to rappel) make it very accessible for both aid and free climbing. Aid ratings and to some degree free climbing protection assume fixed gear is in place.Pitch '1-' (.9): Not technically the first pitch of Town Crier, but accesses the ledge from which the route begins. Climb the hand and finger crack to 4th class ledges, trending right and belaying either at a bolted anchor below P.1 of Green Drag-on, or at a natural belay to the right below a chimney.Pitch 1 (.9): Climb up the chimney to a crux move exiting the chimney. For the free version, belay at the first anchor (atop '12 Angry Bees'). If aiding, continue up cracks to another anchor atop 'Smokeout Ledge'.Pitch 2 (.11c or C2+): The free variation climbs left to an overlap (crux), then up a scary hollow flake and thin cracks to a belay out right. The aid line either goes left out the roof (C2+ with possible pendulum point), or up thin cracks on the face (cam hooks and small nuts) to the same belay.Pitch 3 (.12b/c or C2): The 'Triple Overhangs' pitch. Climb off the belay past fixed gear into a corner. Surmount the overhangs (.12 boulder problem or C2). If free climbing, exit left out of the corner when it starts to seem blank, then climb up and back right to the belay.Pitch 4 (5.11a/b or C2): Climb a thin seam to a flare. Aid or free, the crux is the initial section off the belay.Pitch 5 (5.12d or C1): Climb a flare off the belay (5.10 or C1). Fixed pins lead over a bulge to a bolt ladder. Climb the ladder (5.12d or C1) and belay at the second of two anchors. The free crux climbs a faint flared seam. Not all the bolts can be clipped when free climbing. It is also possible to free climb right of the ladder and rejoin it higher up with a 15-20 foot runout on difficult moves in horizontals.Pitch 6 (dirty 5th class): Join Green Drag-on for a less-than-stellar finish to the top of the wall, or rappel the route.",
        "route_location": "Upon reaching the Upper Town Wall, turn left and up a couple of steep steps to a nice flat spot. The approach handcrack will be obvious a little to the right on the wall. One 60m rope is adequate for descent, although a second would obviously make the rappels more convenient. Alternately, finish the final gully pitch and walk off up and left to meet the Upper Town Wall trail.",
        "route_protection": "Free climbing: Nuts to #9 Black Diamond; I found brass offsets or RP's to be useful, with doubles in the #3-5 range. A single set of cams from #0 C3/equivalent TCU's to #3 Camalot with doubles in the .4 and .5 range is more than adequate. Extra thin cams could be used, but aren't necessary.Aid Climbing: Cam hooks, good nut selection with offsets, doubles in cams from thin to #3 Camalot and possibly a #4 would cover it, but please note that I haven't aided it lately.If some of the pins were missing in certain spots it could change the nature of the climbing, but my impression is that the aid would probably still be clean, especially with modern gadgetry.",

This route features 6 varied technical pitches where you quest through unique geological features on mostly bomb-proof rock with sustained moderate climbing. The crux pitch features a ~25 ft section of 5.11 that can be easily aided making the route go at 5.10+/5.11a C1 for a fun, relatively moderate day.Pitch 1 (5.7, ~40 ft): Climb up the short fist/arm crack. Almost every move can be protected with a #3 or #4 (two 4s are nice to have if at your limit). Belay at the bolt above the crack, at the base of the corner, on gear, or sling the Via Ferrata to make an anchor near the corner (probably easiest). This pitch can be easily skipped by following the hand lines to the base of the Via Ferrata.Pitch 2 (5.10+, ~130 ft): Climb up the long obvious corner through 18 bolts to Madsen's Ledge - don't forget two for the anchor. This pitch is long, sustained, and harder than it looks, but features several great rests to plan your moves out. If you're running out of draws at the end, it should be easy to back clean a couple at the top.Pitch 3 (5.10+, ~50 ft): Move the belay ~20 ft left on Madsen's Ledge to the base of a short steep corner crack. Place a cam and climb up the crack (#4 and 0.5 useful) then make an exciting move up onto the ledge (scary but safe with an attentive belay). Once on the ledge, climb up some face moves through two bolts and gear in between to a Thank God hand crack that leads to the end of this pitch.Pitch 4 (5.11, 80 ft): Starts with a beautiful 5.8 fist crack then slowly increases in difficulty to a series of thin technical balancy moves. Almost all of the 5.11 moves are protected by bolts. Skirt left around the imposing roof and work your way up onto the ledge to finish this pitch near a small tree.Pitch 5 (5.8, 50 ft): This short 4-bolt 5.8 pitch is a nice reward after all the hard work on Pitch 4. From the anchor, make a move right and then follow the bolt-line up (don't get suckered too far right) the fin on a couple cool bucket holds. A #2 is nice to have at the ledge after bolt 4 before walking up to the anchor.Pitch 6 (5.10+, 90 ft): A long, winding pitch. Start in the alcove just to the right of the P4 anchor and work your way up to stand on the obvious hold. A small/offset nut is very nice to have to protect the next move getting to the bolt. Pull on the memorable mono pocket and then work your way up into the sloping right-facing corner/rail. Balance your way up the rail and make a couple thin moves on gear (0.2 useful) to reach a set of bolts and jug holds. Keep working up, placing gear in good pockets (sometimes hard to see - look up and right) until you reach the top. I like to sling a tree at the final crux - a cross-over/step left before reaching the top.",

It will need some traffic to clean up some of the crux sequences (rock was still breaking off in some of the steeper sections), but the climbing is VERY unique, consistently insecure, and hard. Partner and I thought it a bit of a sandbag, especially on the crux pitch. Multiple cruxes on the route seem to require very specific beta to feel like it climbs at the advertised grade. As a trade, though, the sport pitches are generously bolted. The one caveat is the descent. You can rap the route down to Madsen’s ledge, but the anchor there was not equipped to rap when we climbed it (9/2023). We ended up going down the via ferrata for one pitch (in the rain) to an anchor station halfway down the crux pitch off to climber’s right and rapped from there to the first pitch anchors and then to the ground. Perhaps we missed something? Overall a very cool route that is worth the new-route-grit price of admission. Maybe the route will clean up nicely, and I’ll be proven wrong about the sandbag factor!

It's a pretty incredible piece of geology that just needs more people to climb it and spread the word so it stays clean. To answer your question on the rap from Madsen's Ledge - I intentionally didn't add a rap station there in hopes that climbers would descend the way you did. It's too far from Madsen's Ledge to rap straight to the ground with a single 70 and the other rappel station is offset enough sideways across the via ferrata that it didn't seem to make sense to rap there or else you'd be risking a hefty swing into the corner. I was also more worried that folks would accidentally try to rap from there with a single 70 to the ground and either get stuck or worse. I've done the short downclimb on the via ferrata in the rain before as well (I actually prefer the whole downclimb over rapping) and, while annoying, it felt safer than leaving open the potential of folks accidentally rapping into space from the ledge. If you're climbing at Madsen's I think it's safe to assume at least once person is comfortable with that level of downclimb and if you happen to be climbing with someone who's not, I've even lowered friends down to the ground from the Madsen's anchor and downclimbed myself after.

The ultra-technical, near-vertical style of climbing at the Sport Wall has largely fallen out of vogue in modern times in favor of steeper, more athletic climbs. However, in many ways these routes are much more demanding than their steeper brethren and the relatively moderate grades, again with respect to modern standards, will test the mettle of all but the most masterful granite climbers.As of February, 2020,  every established route at this crag has brand new hardware thanks to a monumental effort by Ben Gilkison.

After an initial gear placement climb airy 5.11 edging past three bolts. An easier section in the middle takes a small to medium sized nut before bolts appear again and the difficulty begins to ramp up. Suffice it to say that with relatively few ascents, just where and what comprises the crux is somewhat debatable, but it is most certainly in the vicinity of the last few bolts. For me at 5'7\", there was a reachy move from nebulous, bad holds around the second-to-last bolt, followed by a high-step maneuver that seemed as though it should've been easy but wasn't. One attempt made me throw my shoes in the bushes nearby while the next saw me redpoint, so it probably comes down to minutiae and the vagaries of tricky \"steep low-angle\" climbing. As with most Index routes, it is somewhat temperature dependent and even sunlight filtered heavily by trees on those 80% RH, 80 degree summer afternoons can make an appreciable difference to ones experience and ego.The pitch above this is called Straight to Voicemail.

These two placements may be optional, but I appreciated the insurance they gave me, the first against decking straightaway at the beginning, pulling my belayer down the hill into the vertical woods below and the second against a huge fall on just under vertical rock if my foot happened to slip on some errant lichen. To take advantage of the aforementioned insurance, bring a green or red C4 and a few small to medium nuts along with the 12 quickdraws. The anchor at the top may appear strange but it is a 1/2\" bolt chained vertically to an eye bolt with a gigantic quick link on it: you could probably hang an aircraft carrier from this rig.",

It's got 17 bolts and almost 40m of climbing but you can lower off with a 70m due to the steep slope of the ground. Use a few long slings or back clean a bolt on either end of the traverse for the sake of rope drag.This would make a great choice for the 1st pitch of a 5 pitch amazing sustained hard 5.12 sport* climb:P2: Polyhedron Power (12-)P3: Wildest Dreams (.12-, a few small cams/wires)P4: Heart of the Sportsman (.12)P5: Heart of the Sportsman (.12+)Note added by an admin: Ben G. of Heart of the Sportman fame points out that the above P4 and P5 pitches should be combined as one longer pitch, making the full route to the top 4 pitches total.",

From there it joined up with the DGS route.  The Back Road route description isn’t consistent with following the DGS to the top. (Larry Kemp once told me he started the Back Road from where the picture shows and then could not follow the route to to the top.) But the route description gets closer if you start up DGS p2 and then traverse right to a ledge. Directly down from the right side of this ledge is an overhanging corner with a fixed pin.  This corner is much harder than 5.8/9.  Above the ledge hollow flakes lead up to an overhang. There are rap slings below the overhang.  Above the overhang is a big ledge with an anchor.  Jon and I place this anchor and cleaned off the ledge.  If this is the “Back Road,” then the original route farmed up a crappy gully to the top.  Instead of climbing the gully Jon and I climbed a nice 5.8/9 pitch up an arête that joined the variation finish on DGS.  We found no evidence of previous climbing above this ledge but lots below it.  Free climbing from the DGS to this ledge appears be much harder than the claimed rating.  In addition the hollow flakes look like they would have been mentioned in the description.  Lots of loose rock in this area.  Jon made some special tools to help clean this section but after our fun time on the Golden Road I was nervous of creating a monster. 35/40 years ago Terry told me he climbed “The Back Road” many years earlier and it was a dirty worthless grovel.  He couldn’t really remember details other than the route was terrible.  The only thing that seems to come in at that level of difficulty in the area is the DGS. Conclusions: DGS was climbed many years ago possibly by many independent parties and the current guide has the wrong FA.  (the p3 variation was put up recently) Gunstone and I substantially cleaned the DGS p2 &3.  A very large amount of loose blocks were removed.  This is partly why I was apprehensive about cleaning around the hollow flakes.  Most likely the Back Road followed the DGS and the Beckey description was simply wrong.  The other less likely possibility is the Back Road followed the hollow flakes up to the overhang and the rating was off. Jun 4, 2020",

Pitches 2 and 3 are incredible, especially the third pitch which is super long and varied – it felt like I lived half my life climbing it! I did cheat a bit on pitches 1 and 3 near the end, though. · Lead. Taylor started then we swapped. Mega UTW day!!! I think I like DHLA more but really good still · 2 pitches. Lead. Got the moves of P1 without aid on TR, led P2 clean. Both pitches were quality but not a gimmie · 4 pitches. Lead. Led 2, too worked from HG to lead anything else. P3 crux is burly · Lead / Onsight. Linked up with heaven's gate. only climbed lamplighter once. Climbed with Vadim, fun day · 4 pitches. Lead / Flash. Lamplighter is the crux and least interesting pitch. The remaining pitches are all four star! · 3 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. sent first 2 pitches. too tired and fell at your crux of 3rd pitch. didn't climb the last two pitches because it's late October and getting cold, and we started too late · Lead / Fell/Hung. Great day with Anthony. Led 2 and 4. Fell on upper crux of 3. · 4 pitches. Fell on the lamplighter then bailed off top of 4th pitch due to rain. Sweet route · Lead / Fell/Hung. With Carson, led pitch one and 3. Pitch one beta: high right knee lock unlocks the crux sequence. · Lead / Fell/Hung. P3/p5. Fell once at roof and took at crux. Felt trickier than Heavens gate · 4 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Rapped down to skip p1. Redpoint p2, hung p4, follow 3,5 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Burly ass first pitch that got me gripped and puckered. Favorite pitch was 2-4. Dylan led the harder pitches · Lead / Fell/Hung. Burly first pitch requiring some squirming. Whipped a bunch on p3 but finally pulled it and cruised the last 2 pitches with kai. Amazing route and amazing times! · Lead / Fell/Hung.

Lead 2nd. 1st pitch crux, 3rd pitch tricky. linked 4+5. really good route varied climbing · With Harry. Davis Holland then memorial route awesome day! Mt index covered in snow · Lead.

P3 was quite a challenge for a self-identified crack climber such as myself. · Lead / Onsight. Partner: Leif ?. Led pitches 2 and 4. On sighted both. Pitch 2 ends just after the bolt beneath the roof. It is difficult to see the chains and I wasted time trying to determine how long the pitch was. Pitch 4 is a lot of careful face climbing. Exposed. · Follow. With Randy. Had to pull on the one bolt at the crux of the first pitch and took on the 3rd. Awesome route! Beautiful climb — so much variation!! · 3 pitches.

If you are up for a little bushwacking and the feel of a FA, this is right up your alley! We climbed this yesterday and it was among the dirtiest routes I've climbed (outside of the desert). This route is a truly a diamond in the rough, so long as you can get past the endless spiderwebs, moss, lichen, and foliage. The granite was wonderful, the movement was very fun, and the rock was solid! My partner and I finished on the original P3, which was very short, but still enjoyable. The route is fun, with good jams, and takes mostly hand sized pieces. I didn't place a lot of nuts or small gear, but singles from Tips-#4 Camalot will give you plenty of options. Doubles in the handsizes (.75-#3) are recommended for the 45-meter second pitch, on which I was glad to have brought a #4 camalot. DESCENT can be made with a single 70M rope. Rap from a tree with tat above the final 5.7 pitch or the chains located just left of the 5.9 variation top-out, down to the chains at the top of P2. From P2, rap about 25M to a tree directly below. From the tree, Rap to the climbers right towards the chains at the top of P1. Finally, Rap P1 to the ground. Take care when at the tree rap as there is a large, mini-fridge sized block that is loose and ready to come off. If you're an upstanding steward of the area, you might bring along a brush and/or a broom and do a little cleaning to get this gem into better shape. GO CLIMB THIS! Aug 25, 2016",

Pitch 3 + 4 link up was all bolted · Lead / Onsight. the first two pitches were a bit wet but still doable. the second pitch really took every bit of a double rack and then some. had 3 twos and used all of them. · Lead / Onsight. Started raining after the first pitch. Didn't matter because all the cracks were already soaked. · Lead / Onsight. Led all, 5.9+ fist crack crux pitch was real long with sweet jams and I ran out of gear for the easy second half · 4 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Did variation to arete. Lead pitches 1,3,4. Hung while following p2. · Led P1, P3, and P4. P2 is the money pitch though. Max lucked out there... · Lead. Led P2, fantastic- P1 awkward, did P3 5.9 variation, forgot to walk to other anchors. P3 lichen covered but protects well"

Boulder problem on pitch 4 was easier, just get left foot out then bring left hand up to good hold. Crux was the boulder problem below the roof. Get feet up high. For roof, rock onto the left foot as you come up, then splay right foot out. Climbed with Jason, amazing day. · Lead / Fell/Hung. P2 - fell on first crux - use intermediate hand, sent second P4 - dumb draw grab after crux P5 - took at roof move, sent 2nd try · Lead. Did with Jason, sunny, high of 65. Started at 11:05, done at 2, down by 2:30. Fell on pitch 4 boulder problem, next time focus on left hand getting a bit higher to good jug. Incredible route! Every pitch was gold. Thought the crux was pitch 2 and pitch 4 boulder problem. Pitch 5 boulder problem was a bit challenging, but thought it was pretty straightforward and definitely not 5.11+. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead p2&p4. Felt stiff compared to other areas, but cool, def easier if you’re tall · 4 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. w/ Kate. Got beat tf up by index 11c jesus christ this was hard. Boulder problem at the bottom sucked but the rest was beautiful Index face climbing. Gotta come back to work out the moves! (and do the final pitch) · Lead / Fell/Hung. Climbed with Kevin after Heavens Gate - I think its slightly better then Heavens Gate! Lead P1, P3. I thought P2 was really tricky footwork and pulled on gear twice. Ended up not giving P5 a go my fingerpads were toast and physically pretty beat - Next time! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led 2,4 need to go back to get redpoint on 2 and 5 · Lead. Linked pitches 2 and 3, 4 and 5, with 22 draws and a 70 meter rope, up and down in 2h 22 m. Blew the onsight on the crux of the last pitch. · Lead / Fell/Hung. led pitches 2 and 4. fell on p2 and roof of p5. w Chris Farrah · Led 1-3, followed 4-5 for a fun team send with Brittany. Really nice line and not hard for the grade. First pitch was wet, making the clips pretty reachy. · Lead. W Jess sept 23 lol made up date Swapped leads. Overhang hard but eventually got it. · Lead. Awesome!!! bailed on p5 as sun disappeared. gotta return and crush. super fun, modern grade · Lead / Onsight. great route. every pitch is worth climbing ~I fell on the first move of P1 when I tried to climb it too far to the right. literally in the first 10ft. started over and sent everything after. · Lead. So desperately close to sending the crux. Foot beta is key to sending! · Lead / Fell/Hung. led p1 and 4. hung on 2 and 5. aided the sloper crux on 4. pretty hot today and my toes were dieing in bouldering shoes · Lead / Onsight. The day started out ominous with clouds and rain threatening. But Tania and I prevailed clawing our way through pitch after pitch. While we watched other parties bail we topped out the golden road in a blaze of glory… Highly recommend. · Follow. fell at the tough little boulder on the 11- pitch. hardest moves on the route! fun day w Jesse · Lead / Fell/Hung. Flash on 1st and 2nd. Led 3rd pitch. Followed on 4th and 5th. One fall per pitch · Lead / Redpoint. A climb so nice, I did it twice. This time with Waiwai. Led P1+2, 4 and 5. Waiwai led P3 with one fall. Total time 3:33. · Lead / Onsight. With Ryder and Woody. Followed P1+2 clean, OS P3+4 and 5. Cool gaston moves on P2, interesting crux on P4 and the roof on P5 is incredible. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung on first pitch? Random, just a whee bit cold to start · Follow. Pulled on so much gear but still tried hard! Evan and iwis made sure I was ok, some parts too scary, lots too hard, so much fun :) great day after losing my keys at first! · Lead / Onsight. With Adam, soo good! I linked 1 and 2, Adam linked 3 and 4, and we both lead pitch 5. · Lead / Onsight. Onsighted every pitch! That roof on the 5th pitch is so mega. Some reason I felt the crux of the 11- 4th pitch was harder than anything else · Lead. got 11a pitch clean. Need to come back and do 11c pitch, remember to get high right foot · 4 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. 1,3,4. So damn good, this thing should have a line up · 4 pitches. Follow. Led p3, followed 1,2,4. Fell a few times, so much fun linking those sequences.

Step slightly down from the anchor and undercling traverse hard left on a flake under BNS \"Frog Corner\" you will pass a bolt with couple face moves. once on the arete climb straight up till at the height of the anchor and step left to anchor. .9P3- Crux pitch. Undercling out left on featured stone and make a move to a horizontal dike. Pull a quintessential Index move and continue straight up to ledge ( BNS p2 anchor is on this ledge but on right) from ledge traverse hard left on slopers and crimps to the anchor out on the face ( dont go to BNS anchor) .11-P4- A fine mostly bolted pitch. Continue straight up on good face holds to a large flake where you can place a #3 or #4 camalot (optional #5) pass many bolts and a finger or two size cam to a large ledge (Sabbath Ledge) .10P5- Jugs and rails lead to the sky. .9P6- A fine hand crack goes up to a face move or two to more splitter cracks to the top of the wall. .9The last two pitches make for a fine alternative to the last two pitches of BNS route. Its also best to link the last two pitches. The anchor atop p5 is mostly in place for Rappel. The rap route goes straight down to the anchor at base of p3.

Of the three: golden road, heavens gate, and this climb, this one is clearly the best. Stellar movement over cool features with memorable climbing. Did this one with Matt Michie while sick lol— shoulda heard my ass wheezing up there on point · Lead. With Ian. Pretty sick route. Onsighting pitch 2 was a cerebral experience.

Could do purp metolius below. Then .1, .2, purple metolius, grey metolius. Another small can for the easy finish to sew it up. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Onsighted all but 5.12 pitch. Fell twice. Crux pitch easy to aid and rehearse. Blue aliens are $. 2 good burns and then moved on. Next go:-). 11b pitch is outrageously good. Pitch 1 and 3 are stellar too.

Why, you might ask? Take a seat pilgrim, and bear witness to the tale I am about to tell.Does the name Spaced Man Spliff sound familiar, yet you can't quite place where you've seen it before? That is probably because at one point there may have been another route in Index by the same name, though if it ever really existed its location has long since been lost to time and the failings of human memory. The only evidence that it may or may not have ever existed lies on the back of the Index T-Shirt, an iconic symbol that has come to represent the almost cult-like reverence held for the Index Town Walls by all who have spent time in its ethereal forests and on its proud granite walls.Made by Richard Ellison, a Seattleite and old school local climber, the back of the Index T-shirt has a checklist of what at first glance appears to be the crag's most classic climbs. Upon further inspection however, there are a handful of routes that don't make any sense; the main one of which is Spaced Man Spliff. I was on a quest to complete the entire list; a feat that had never before been accomplished, so I needed to track it down. I had looked in every guidebook that had ever been printed about Index and found no record of a climb by that name, so I asked Rich about it. He had no memory of what this mysterious climb was (if it had ever even been). I posted on the Climb Index! facebook group for leads  and got a few rumors, but nothing concrete. I asked many of the OGs that had been climbing at Index for many years; still nothing. Eventually I concluded that it was something I would have to create myself in order to complete the T-shirt list. It didn't need to be a classic, not everything on the list is; it just needed to exist.Finally I narrowed my remaining climbs on the list down until Spaced Man Spliff was one of two remaining (the other being Davis-Holland, which was to be my last). I had found this line while working Young Cynics, skipped over by the other developers of the Wall of Voodoo; perhaps for good reason. It was buried deep under a thick layer of typical Index vegetation, but a bit of scraping revealed a crack underneath. From the ground it looked quite promising.Unfortunately the climb didn't end up being all that great, with a short boulder problem crux protected by bolts, and easy gear climbing above and below. In the end that might be fitting though, because the next person to try and complete the T-shirt list will probably have to find it all over again under the ferns and moss that will inevitably reclaim it just like I did. Half the adventure of completing the list is getting off the beaten path onto things one wouldn't otherwise climb, or even know about. Better yet, perhaps they might just put up another Spaced Man Spliff of their own that is a little more worthy.",

Crack pretty wavy, get eyes on cams. Bring 3x 0.4-0.5, 0.3-0.5 offset cams too, 1x0.3 and nothing smaller, 2x 0.75, 1x #2 (#1 maybe better). Save a 0.5 for the end · Follow. Perfect day to be out on the rocks! Aaron got to do his redemption lead on this one - he first climbed it without any climbing experience and got to the 2nd clip. Today he led it clean! Shannah also followed on top rope :) Surprisingly I loved the wide pinch section - super beefy. And then of course the transition from under the overhang to stepping out on the flake. All around a perfect climb! · Lead / Onsight. Extremely dirty leading into the crack. You will be mantling with your hands and feet in muddy tuff. Recommended to place a piece low to protect from a ground fall if you slip here. If dry, probly not an issue. Upper half is money and clean and almost entirely dry. · Lead / Onsight. Ramp was wet - took some shenanigans, cleaning, and teamwork to get up safely. Colin whipped a nut in above the ramp. Pretty epic. Clean lead after that. Wet for about 10 ft above the piton even after 3 days of sun prior. Inside of crack itself was dry though, only edges, face, and feet were wet. · Follow. TR followed Bill’s lead. No falls. Super fun climb, felt really burly for a 5.8, but not my normal style · Lead / Flash. Did this one twice this summer — first time was alright, especially compared to breakfast of champions… last move is a beach whale to the top. Tried the route again a month later and it was actually so fun and chill · Lead. So good. Crack hands, no feet in crack, perfect. Interesting undercling wedge yourself in roof. Fun roof to pull after. Interesting moves and plenty of rest whole way up. Confidence booster! · Lead / Onsight. So fun A great #2 and everything else small Takes great nuts · Lead / Onsight. fun scramble up the finger to small hands. appreciate the mini traverse to gain the mantle and sidepull under the anchor was a great option. great pieces everywhere · 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Good warmup. Protects well once you get established on the ledge. Fun! W/ Tanner and Josh · Follow. 5th and final route of the inaugural outdoor day. Was fun. Less crack climbing than the other routes today. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Foot slipped at crux but finished, BB’s first trad lead and crack climb"

The crux is climbing the thin crack/weird arch at the start (kind of off balance laybacking) and making a reach to a jug at the top where the crack ends.The section above the first bolt has several  RP placements.When dirty the moss here is like ball bearings but when clean the rock is quite grippy.Once good holds are reached the next protection is the second bolt.This section is relatively easy but you wouldn't want to fall here.Above the second pin a LFC is followed to the anchor.Not sure what to make of the 5.12 r/x rating in the current guide. I put R here just because a fall above the crux would be bad and the guidebook claims a r/x rating. The climbing in this section is much easier than crux and basically is just standing on the jugs reached after the crux. That said   Its easily top roped as it shares an anchor with another route.   The climbing up the arch is really fun so give it a go!",

Led up a few bolts, left it to Ethan to wrap up the lead & made it up on TR. Dirty disgusting offwidth<3 · Lead. Clean til final bolt, then ran out of energy. Exhausting but really fun. · Lead. Hung a lot and brought gear. Bring #3, 4, .75 for top & .3 for bottom · Lead / Onsight. Haley and Ksenia led. Felt pretty good about getting this one. You really just have to trust the lay back for a lot of the climb. At the 4th bolt, I got into the crack to secure my entire leg to clip. I used a #3 before the 1st bolt and a #.75 between the last 2 bolts. · TR. Top rope solo. Fell twice but mostly still dialing in my top rope solo setup · Lead / Fell/Hung. climb for Quena’s photos. SADLY this was more cracky sport than sporty crack. hardest 10a ever but perhaps it’s the lack of crack technique?? big struggle up the wall ~ · TR. Hard climb! Bailed halfway up, wasn't feeling it today. The first bottom section is probably the trickiest bit. · TR. Still not the gorilla my dreams but a little more than last time · Lead / Fell/Hung. Thought this was the 5.8+ timber jack and got rocked haha. Sustained layback with gear and a few bolts. Think I took twice, good effort but OW is a challenge for me sometimes and laybacks are scary on gear. But stoked I got up it · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got maybe almost there then felt scared and body tired. It’s too hot and my body is not ready for hard climb. Felt like a 10d · Lead / Fell/Hung. Top section wet and not interested in passing. Will do again · Follow. Clean follow. Would be pretty intense on lead, especially the clip right at the roof (pretty far out right). Some good heal toe cams, knee locks, and liebacking (mostly this) to be had. · Lead / Fell/Hung. wigged myself out clipping the 3rd or 4th bolt from a shitty kneebar, then hung to get it back together. Otherwise not too bad, just burly · TR. TR Solo. Very burly. No way it’s a 5.10a. Would be a scary lead but likely a safe one. · Lead / Onsight. Felt insecure, good mental test. Placed .4 and .75, would bring a #4 next time. TRed after bc it was so fun! · Follow. Took the biggest whip of my life at the 4th bolt. Rope was also behind my leg so it was quite the ride. Feet at meh there. Then followed on top rope. If you’re a crimpy sport climber, this one’s quite the challenge! · Lead / Flash. Omfg what a climb! Stellar laybacking up an improbable looking flake. The OW at the top detracts a tad, but it’s still good — just dirty. Kevin hung the draws. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Definitely need to work on my granite footwork.... Laybacked too hard and got seriously pumped. · Lead / Onsight. Really fun and more airy/spooky than hard. Didn’t off width anything but if would be fun to try. With Andrew and Maple! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Turns out climbing this with a pack full of gear was p hard · Lead / Fell/Hung. Ran out of juice before 4th bolt and bailed. Rapped down later to retrieve draw · Lead / Fell/Hung. so much power! Spent lots of time figuring out how to get the feet high on the crux and then figuring out to cam into that offwidth. A good index climb. · Lead. My first outdoor lead! Hung on it once both times I went up, but made it to the top. · Lead / Onsight. Great movement. Lots of kind of tricky moves, a little endurance, and plenty of decent rest. · Lead / Onsight. Fun climb. Would be fun to climb on gear. Climbed as approach to Mid wall, but someone had moved rope b/w chains and tree, making move to tree bit sketchy (RC) · Lead / Fell/Hung. sweb got up half way, whipped twice, and asked me to ropegun. it was a suuuuuuper cool, long, layback pitch. being so sustained, it was definitely harder than 10a. it brings a solid right arm pump · Lead / Fell/Hung. Used stick clip to get up and then got it clean. Lock in that lie back · TR. TRS, one hang before the big move out right 2/3 up. End of day, just burnt, also sustained and hard. Look for mini rests. All moves clean, but top section really slipper, dirty and desperate, knee jammed a couple times for a rest. Dry ish down low, but needs some serious cleaning! · Lead / Redpoint. Fell at the last bolt, took a whip going for the clip (at least 25 feet!) Solid route, sustained liebacking with a physical crux · Lead / Redpoint. Fell before on top rope so had some unfinished business. Solid laybacking was the key. Had a great time hanging out with the roomies! Alana belayed me while danny belated Evan on timberjack. · Lead / Onsight. strong lay back with a tricky off width step around move. · Lead / Onsight. Laybacking gets pumpy by the end. Crux for me was first move over onto the flake. Pretty fun. · Follow. Followed Chris from Outer Space up this route with a full back pack (3 L H2O + double rack of cams) · Follow. Fine pitch but do *not* with heavy pack to access the mid walls. This really sucks · Lead / Fell/Hung. powerful lean back. got to second to last bolt. too hungover; almost puked"

A few small falls and bailed at the beginning of the upper off width bc I didn’t have wide gear · Lead / Onsight. Fun and weird. Why layback when you have perfect thigh jams?! · Lead / Onsight. Good warmup on the way to the mid walls to climb PBR and FB. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took right before moving into OW near top. Should get clean next time. Alpine draw, 3, 2, draw, 5. · Lead / Flash. Preclipped the first bolt since the bottom of the climb was soaking wet. One of the best 5.8s at Index but still like Aries the most. Felt slightly easier than Mourning Star. · TR. With Kat.

Lead / Redpoint. Easy to love projecting the warmup when it’s this fun :) With Garrett and Garrett from epc! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Stick clip or high reach the first bolt then do a little dynamic high step + jump to the high rail. Several very high and somewhat strenuous reaches to hang draws before committing moves. Really fun moves up high though! · Lead / Fell/Hung. couldn't figure out the face climbing crux left of the corner before the roof, thin-ish sidepull was hard to use · TR. Aided the first move then another move in the middle. Not sure how to free this (reachy). Ridiculous leads by Eric. · Lead / Fell/Hung. siiiick. gotta go back for the rp on this beauty. thanks nate! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Pulled on the first draw and a few takes on the rest of the route.

Top rope, bottom section is easier than it looks and protects well, but bolted slab on top is hard and a bit mental · TR. Jacob Yang led, and I top-roped cleanly. The short crack needs maybe two pieces, like #0.5 and #0.75. All the moves feel relatively-doable for me, I should perhaps try to lead this next time. Easy to access the top anchor from Jam Session too. · TR. Cleanly top roped it! Will try to lead next time, slab moves would be very scary though · Lead. Climbed with Burgess - clean this time. I absolutely love this route such great practice on Index slab - trust your feet its better than it looks! Cool finger crack start. · Lead. Climbed with Burgess - foot slip on the slab lets try it again! · Lead. two 0.4s in the crack, shift feet in small increments getting over the bulge part of the slab. · TR. Want to come back and lead this one. Bottom crack takes 2 .5’s and is not that hard. High right foot, then stem · TR. Great slab problem for me to work on. For the bottom part I needed to use the crack on the right and the arete on the left to work my way up. I fell once (?) on the delicate slab above. · TR. fell a bunch but finished. middle section of finger crack is a little wide, tape up next time. · Lead / Fell/Hung. One mini fall when trying to rest the feet and wasn’t paying attention. One actual fall at cruxy section near horizontal seam. Beta at seam: stepped left out from chipped dish edging to friction-y higher left foot. Brought right up to high friction non obvious lower angle patch . Reached up to knob? Slowly reached out to opposite Gaston with right hand. Slowly brought left foot up to above seam, keeping foot in line with body to reduce side force. Powerful pistol squat with aid of knob/gaston. Brought right foot out, sort of stemming across intermediate section. · Lead / Onsight. Super fun and spicy slab climbing! Loved the high feet and trusting moves. Definitely have your friend go first though so you're not the one clearing pine needles off the crimps. · Lead / Flash. for full value, don't use the jugs to the left when starting the slab section · TR. Set up top rope with directionals from Jam Session. Crack feels awesome, should go back and lead. The slab felt like it would be scary on lead. Very well protected by bolts tho so it should be super safe. · TR. Avoided finger crack by bumping up the right arete, top slab is crazy fun · Lead / Onsight. Fun! Felt like LCC in Index. Felt fair at 10b (maybe even 10a). Finger crack is a bit cruxy, the rest isn't too stout. Only a few actual slab moves on this thing. Generously bolted which makes it feel mellow(er). W/ Tanner, Zac and co after cool via feratta and bridge approach from K-Wall. · Lead / Onsight. Lead onsight rope solo, 2nd week in a row was smoother. · Lead / Redpoint. Slabby friction!! Crux is at the top below the last bolt. And final crux before chansons for short people. · Lead / Flash. In TCs. Slipped at the top corner and almost fell off, which would’ve been dumb, but somehow caught myself"

Gear beta: 0.5 (removed later), QD, QD, 1, 0.2, 0.5, 0.3, 0.4, 0.2, ? · TR. SUCH A GOOD ONE. Will be thinking about this for quite some time. Such a great finger crack. Definitely a bit of a project and weird crack sizes, but so fun to figure out! · Lead / Redpoint. Got this on the second go. Amazing climb. One of my absolute favorite trad leads to date. Also sent this in the dark, which is always more fun · Lead / Fell/Hung. Trying to flash but got stopped at the entrance to the crack. Fell off the crack maybe 3 times but figured it all out. Hard. Would be 11b in Squamish. Bring extras in the .4 size. · Lead / Redpoint. Felt like an onsight after not having tried in over a year. Great warm up finger crack · Lead / Fell/Hung. One hung on second go! Bit hard to place gear higher up but eats 0.3-5. Pod below crux takes a 0.75 and 1 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Was going great until I lost the feet at the roof and hung. Hung on upper. Made a mess of it · Lead / Redpoint. First attempt today. Rack same as last lap, move through the crux and don't place the blu tot, wait til better stance and place blk tot + draw. STOKED · TR. 1 fall that I saved with left finger lock. Strained my lat but didn't weight rope · Lead / Redpoint. Felt solid. Fumbled a little with 3rd placement before finding good placement Gear: - bolt - bolt - 0.4 grey Alien - 0.3 blue Totem - 0.2 green alien - 0.2 black Totem · 4 pitches. TR. TRS 4 laps: reg TR 1 fall after crack switch, mock lead foot slip in middle crux, mock lead clean but slab felt iffy, mock lead clean with smooth slab. Gear: Left: 0.1/0.2 Offset, red tot+draw, blk tot, 0.5 z4, 0.3 z4, purp tot. Right: 0.3/0.4 Offset, qdx2, yel tot, blk tot+draw (top of R crack), 0.4/0.5 Offset (or 3rd 0.5, or skip). Really plan out locks and feet, don't place 0.3 from shit stance in middle anymore. L hand flared thumbs down jam, R finger jam below it to do crack switch. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Really good. Made it through the roof but struggled with my feet higher up. Wanted to try again but there was a line :/ · TR. Kept working it in top rope, no clean run, but that wasn't the point. The crux roof protects well with a small cam and you can place #1 before that. The roof itself is not that hard - there are two tiny footholds and you can layback to the left while walking your feet on corner/features. Good ring locks higher up get you standing on chicken heads (streanous). The top ring lock (left hand) is thin and more solid. From there, right foot up to the base of a small \"corner\". convert to lay back (again lean left). You can then place your left foot in the corner (smear, but surprisingly ok) and move right to top of buldge. This is probably real crux. Hard cam placement from the layback, then left hand transitions to the left crack. Easier from there, and pro opportunity in both cracks. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Figured out how to pull into the crack. Left hand thumbs up jam in bottom of crack. Left foot smear (with slight drop knee rotation). Then casually reach right hand up as high as you can and jam until you can step up onto ledge. Gear: - bolt - bolt - 0.4 - 0.5 - 0.3 - 0.3 - 0.5/0.4 offset ? Cant remember if I placed or not - black totem - 0.4/0.3 offset In left crack (wouldn’t place again) · Lead / Fell/Hung. Flash attempt (no beta, but had seen it done). Fell right below the anchor onto an unnecessary poor #1 placement (first proper trad lead fall!). Use different beta next time: pinch the blocky outcrop and get under it to sort of layback. On the bottom section traversing right at the bolt, commit to the right crack/corner completely earlier - actually makes it easier (Viper beta). · Lead / Redpoint. started up and biffed at first draw, lowered, removed draw with a stick clip, and went back up to fire it! superb. with Nina! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Did way worse on the bottom part of the climb and then did much better on the second half of the climb. Not sure what to make of this. · TR. Jacob Yang led, then I top-roped. Hard for me, I fell a few times on top-rope. Excellent pitch of climbing though. · TR. TR to upper crux, lead to finish to get gear back for jacob. · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. hung twice on slab, clean from second bolt to chains. TR lap after the sploink went buttery. cranker locks. · TR. Feet slipped several times. Struggled through roof and subsequent finger crack. So basically the whole route. Really fun! · Lead / Fell/Hung. fell at the start of the slide pull crack on left · TR. Big weighted assist to get on and through crack from Cole! Super fun · Follow. Fun as shit finger locks. Met Doug and his all lady posse. Such a good crag for hot days - lots of shade! · TR. get left side in after second bolt, push up into the jug. stay basically on bolt line to second bolt then go right. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Wet. Should be doable dry. Bring three .4, three .3, two .5, one .2 for the top, one 1 for the low horiz crack (this will be more than enough) · Lead / Fell/Hung. A bit wet. Fell at the top. Next time try to lay back a couple moves at the crack switch · Lead / Fell/Hung. Sent on TR but not lead, kind of horrible kind of fun. Will come back for it! · TR. Blew off the slab moving right to dihedral but otherwise clean. Good ringlocks to pull into crack. .75/1 in horizontal. Pull into crack and get feet on ledge before placing · TR. Clean. .3 before bolt. Left sidepull left hand. Step right foot to left to stay in balance bringing left foot in the right foot to dihedral. 1 left 75 right in horizontal. Right hand pod, left thumbs down in crack right thumbs down pull up shift get comfortable place gear. .4 high. Pull through thin middle to good jam high. .3 grab left side stem .4 .5 step across · TR. clean first try. slab down low felt like the crux. money locks after getting established in crack · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell my way up. Need the finger crack practice, always feel like I'm slowly slipping out. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Feels like it will go next time. Worked out where the good locks are · TR. Gave it two burns. Got it clean on the second one. Need to try it on lead when I’m feeling fresh! · Lead / Redpoint. Fell on first go trying to transition between the two cracks. Figured out some beta, then sent on second go. Awesome climb. Good intro for breaking into harder Index grades · Lead / Redpoint. Fun afternoon/eve sesh w/ Jonathan. Happy to send on my second session with this route. Bravo to the FAist for uncovering this gem. · TR. Bottom is still very delicate feeling. Hardest part for me was transitioning into the crack · Lead / Redpoint. 1 hung on the crux, lowered and rested, then sent. Definitely worth getting on, would do again and again. · 3 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. One fall at roof pull then got the redpoint 3rd go. QD, QD, 1&0.75, 0.5,.3,.2, .4 Just warm up for goodness sake W EO · 4 pitches. TR. QD, QD, 1&.75, .5, .3,(.4), .4, Anchor. Last 2 goes very good · Lead / Redpoint. Whipped a couple times figuring out the top then sent! So stoked. · Lead / Fell/Hung. a fall and a hang fixing gear on the flash burn · Lead / Redpoint. Got the send 2nd go by the skin of my teeth! Left hand small gaston on slab move going to the horizontal. Place .4 before and below left traverse, then get thumbs down L finger jam, perch left foot, place another .4 or .5 and gun it for the top · 3 pitches. TR. (.4), QD, QD, 1 & (.75), step up on crux .5, (.3), .4, .2, .75 (.5), QD. · Lead / Fell/Hung. just slipped out in the finger crack, not in climbing shape this season · TR. Clean follow. Compress with the right seam as you move to the chains. · Lead / Redpoint. W/ Adam. Hardest trad lead so far!! Not great at fingers and took multiple whips on gear. Left crack has a jug but you got keep reaching up to find it. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Climbed with Logan - I fell on the lower part but sent the gear section. Bring your fingy locks for this one! Sweet route! · stick clip first bolt or .4 down low. another draw, then triple .3-.5 and a .75 to sew it up. two cruxy sections for me. easy once you get into the last crack. · TR. don't like lower slab crux or upper crux, but there be lots of good fingers on this route."

Climbed with Logan - great practice for the classic down turning and slick chicken head knobs at Index. · TR. oof da. big pistol squat on ok foothold and then a powerful crimp layback move · Lead / Onsight. Booty’d a beaner, fun moves last reach above the chains aint that bad, it’s all there. · TR. Short, really challenging after the third bolt. No tricks as far as I could tell. · TR. Fun moves! Especially once the beta is unlocked. It is definitely harder than it looks from the ground. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell and whipped several times at the crux mantle until finally getting the move but being too tired to top out at the anchors. Would love to come back and get it clean on lead. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got it after one fall. Super hard for a couple moves. · Lead / Onsight. Everyone at the crag told me this route was really hard at the grade, but I found it quite reasonable - only really one move that earns the grade. Moving up higher to get my chest at the bolt level of the anchors was the true crux, but felt a little silly since I had already clipped them. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Tried it, so hard!! Need to learn how to use granite better · TR. Couldn’t do the move to get above the 3rd bolt. Maybe with fresher fingers to haul on the rail but it was really hard. Even the final move to anchor was really hard crimp lock and push of friction knob · Follow. Holy crap this was hard, way harder than it looked. Spent some time scrubbing it thanks to a brush from some local developers. Grabbed the arete on the left at the end to pull for chains · Lead / Fell/Hung. not clean this time, just mantle it with a high left · Lead. At 3rd bolt- R side pull, L hand on round hold, R foot up, L above it · Lead / Redpoint. I thought the mantel crux was harder than the start of Zoom, and about on par with Climax Control (maybe just a little easier). The move to the chains isn't trivial, either. Considering that, I'd call this 11a, but all the hard stuff comes in a very short, condensed section. · TR. It's only kinda slab climbing. Just crimp and mantle up on the thin rail, then tiptoe left to the arete/jug rail and up to the chains. 1 slip above mantle on nothing feet. Hard slab at this wall."

    "area_getting_there": "There are at least five ways to access Mid Wall.1) Take the Seamstress route after hiking up to K-Cliff (see images linked to route).2) Hike up all the way from K-Cliff using fixed lines as described below:Traverse right along the base of K-Cliff and follow the trail up the gully past the Lip. Traverse along the faint trail above the Black Wall to the base of Winkie Dinkie. Pass Gorilla my Dreams and walk towards the top of Breakfast of Champions, keeping an eye out for a gully on the left. Go up the gully on a fixed line, then a 50' via ferrata that eventually passes through the tunnel. Now you are on top of Julie's Roof. Follow a second fixed line and a goat trail to a blocky narrow passage. (If you take this third fixed line down you'll access all of the top of the Lower Wall.) If you go up the fixed line, you'll be at the Middle Wall.Update: June 2014: There appears to be no fixed lines on this route now.Update Aug 2020: There are 2-3 fixed lines and a short via ferrata3) Via Winkie Dinkie cliff. Climb something at the Great Northern Slab, Princely Ambitions, or hike in from the trail between K-Cliff and the Lip, and then climb Gorilla My Dreams (or the above fixed lines) to get up there.4) Do a route that either tops out on the Narrow-Arrow end of the Lower Wall, or the wall left of Orc Tower.5) Hike the trail that goes to the Upper Town Wall (from the Country), taking the first turnout left. Where the Blues Cliff trail forks off left, stay right and continue across the top of the Lower Wall. This is a fun hike, but be careful about the dilapidated stairs. Also use caution on the exposed wooden bridge.",

Missed slot hold and whipped at 3rd bolt - so dumb. Remember to look for hands and feet when climbing · TR. Pulled on gear because I didn’t take the time to find the holds. They are all there just look. · TR. Paul put in a high redirect which made this much better to TR. Loved the corner, lots of quite good flakes/layback holds that aren’t apparent til you get there. Moving R onto the chickenheads was hard! Big move for me but fortunately at the bolt. Had to dyno to. LH but it was sinker! Above that my arms were 100% stretched out haha. One slip when moving up RF but when I readjusted to bumping that first it went more easily. The “roof” had some awkward bits, hands were more tenuous, then cruiser above! · TR. Toprope off the shared anchor with MW crack. Crack is pretty good, knobs are harder for short people. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Should have sent, but got spooked after struggling to clip the last bolt before leaving the flare and took. Oh well. Knobs are fun. · TR. Legit. Reaching the knobs at the top of the crack was definitely crux and at my limit. · TR. seems like 2 options, did both. the slab out on the right face is rad. but straight up makes more sense. · TR.

Rest went well. · Lead / Redpoint. *Fell at bulge and lowered, didn’t pull rope and climbed it with that gear pre-clipped. · Follow. Lead some of it and then bailed. Also couldn’t get the bottom move. · TR. Can lead this, super super small gear at the top like 0s if u have em, bring one 2 for just before the traverse. Roof beta is in my photos from sept 8. Top is spoopy but protectable · TR. Keep hands high ( far left of the flake) for Bouldery Crux. Traverse into finger crack and use knobs to climb up. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Not clean at the bottom but still did the move. Rest was cruiser and awesome · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at the crux a few times - great route! Bouldering crux followed by a long sustained finger crack · TR. Lu and I got to TR this after a fellow gal climber put it up. So fun on TR. I laid back and walked feet up then got the right foot into the wedge and left foot out and pulled my right thigh to get into the pod. So cool! Thanks to the gals for figuring out the beta for the crux move. Loved the entire climb. Fun stem section and little knobs with the finger crack in the upper section. · Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Clemo - really enjoyed this route! Layback to kneebar rock over for the roof and fingers are easier than they look. In hindsight Id place more than one piece below the roof that's the business and has ground fall potential. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at low crux. Clean go on TR after. Have beta for layback down. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took a nice whip first go on the boulder problem. Got it second go and sent it to the chains. · Lead / Redpoint. asterisk on the lead. i took a fall pulling the ledge on the boulder problem at the beginning, but the move or two i didnt do from that hang are trivial. anyway this was sick. aaron n max were there. · Lead / Redpoint. put the burners on for the low crux and cruised the rest of the way. always bring doubles in your tinys, you’re in index motherfucker! With Paddington · Lead / Redpoint. Second go, blew the bottom first time around. The top is very fun!! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Layback move at the roof spanked me good. After that nice 10a climbing · Lead / Fell/Hung. Left foot a little out left. Don't try to bring it up to right. Works hands up very high until you can get high right foot and kneebarish · TR. Hardest 10c - .5’s through crust layback bulge - right hand right, left hand slaps arete, get right toe in crack at lip (footjam below) · TR. Did it cleanly without rope help! Would definelty lead next time I’m here. One of my index favorites so far · Lead / Fell/Hung. So confident after doing it on TR a year ago and then totally failed lol. Maybe more than five minutes of rest would help??? who could say · Lead / Fell/Hung. Still had to aid through the first section. Couldn’t figure it out on lead. Looks like from videos, right foot flag to get into layback, right foot up, left foot up under, right foot *high* (almost near hands), left foot press into wall bumping up hands and pulling hard, right foot/heel into crevice and rock over it. Bring either double 0.4s and plug one low in the crux bulge or triple 0.5s and plug two down low. Only need single 1. Triple 0.2s is good for the upper crack. Smallest ball nut for initial step around if possible. · TR. Clean TR burn after one fall in the crux. Will lead next time. · TR. Tried to lead this and whipped like 5 times at the crux. Then top roped it · TR. 2 TR laps. pinned right hand against the arete with knee, lol. don't do that when leading · Lead / Fell/Hung. Foot slipped at the crux, first trad fall, had two bomber cams · Lead / Fell/Hung. Place the .5 as high as possible for real!! Use the left foot rail · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell three times at bottom. Didn’t read old beta, couldn’t figure it out after falls, ended up aiding through. Think I need to layback, bring both feet up and out to side to bump them up, then bring left foot back over for support after right foot is up on top. Feet kept slipping in layback but I think it was because I had them too low. Upper crack was fair but I was a bit rattled from the bottom and didn’t want to commit to moving around and getting back in the finger crack. Thin gear was okay but was up in my head trying to not block the good holds. Maybe strategy is to find the good holds, then place gear at waist/below hands so I know I’m not blocking future holds? · TR. Clean top rope send. Beta on the bottom bulge. Layback out right from the 0.5 crack, bumping hands up and setting left foot out the left to relieve hands someone. Rock up over while grabbing crack (ring lock/finger stack?) down low to get into corner. Finger crack up top is THIN. Index/middle finger tips. Definitely want a healthy number of 0.2 size cams probably and some micro nuts to sew this thing up. Don’t cross over into the finger crack too early or it’ll be too thin. · Lead / Fell/Hung. didn't read it right down low. such a sick upper finger crack. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Layback and paste feet on right corner. Left foot on rail, get knee up. Placed a bunch of .2s and .3s in finger crack · Lead / Fell/Hung. Aided the crux. Was fine up top. Super burly crux. Harder than it looks. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Brutally hard, get that .5 as high as possible and then commit to the laybacking. Bring lots of .1-.3 for the final tips part. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at the crux but eventually pulled it. The rest is cruiser · Lead / Fell/Hung. 3-4 hangs because I was trying to ring lock and then eventually I realized I could lie back!!! Amazing · TR. surely much harder on lead. probably 3x black totem or equivalent for upper section, 4x if you really want to sew it up. couple nut spots as well. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 3 falls on gear, yeehaw! All trying to figure out the crux down low. Wow it’s physical and insecure. Gotta get your feet high up in the crack and then get a shitty foot out left in a scoop. Very committing pulling it. Yellow metolius protects very bottom. .4 and then high .5 protects the crux. Top is stellar and eats .1 - .3. · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Lower overhang is the crux. Use the higher rail and keep bumping feet till into the crack · Lead / Fell/Hung. had to aid past the low crux, but climbed the rest cleanly. top section is incredible · Lead / Flash. Awesome crux move and finger crack at top! Bomber .5 at crux. · Lead / Redpoint. Get gear up high, back off, fire the layback on left stem ledge and high right to foot knob with possible knee bar. Climbed with Brad on a crowded Sunday · Lead / Fell/Hung. thumb catch, r foot high, l foot edge, work hands up, l toe crystal, r high to knee bar, press over. black totems and smaller in crack. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Crux is hard but super fun. Fell a bunch there before figuring it out. · TR. This climb is awesome! Getting over the bulge at the bottom is a really tricky move, need to get a high right foot. The fingercrack is awesome because the chicken heads are great footholds · TR. Fell on the crux the first attempt but got it on the second try while actually crack climbing it (rather than laybacking it). Upper section is really fun and very cool features/knobs. Would love to lead this at some point! · TR. Fucking hard!! Crux is the roof bulge at the bottom. Very tricky body positioning, then thin slab at the top · TR. Very burly lieback to mantle start, then tenuous tips seam up top. Didn't particularly enjoy · TR. Layback at crux is way easier. Get knee into groove and you're golden."

First time I tried this about five years ago I couldn't even get into the dihedral because there was nothing for hands.  Now there are great finger locks and good (but small) gear. I just lead it for the first time on Thursday after having TR'd many times.  The chimney which is much easier than Butt-lips on Aries was my concern on gear.  I just had to get my head around it and go.  It took a #5 but I wish I'd had Geoff's #4 too.  Jerry followed with approach shoes he wants to take to the Bugaboos and did fine. This route is no harder than Timberjack, the upper pitch of Magic Fern, or Aries/Lizard so yes, I think it is a 5.8.  It is easier than Toxic Shock, Wet Dream and Battered Sandwich and Plumb Pudding which Geoff agrees is a 5.9.  It has great variety and fun moves - I'll keep coming back. Jul 21, 2013",

Recent rains have re-deposited a bit of dirt in the finger crack but not enough to render it unusable--I scraped out some with my nut tool but that section will likely need more attention after the wet season to keep it in such nice condition. I had only a #4 for the chimney which made it feel a little heady (a #5 would have helped, as the #4 was tipped) but it sure is fun --climbs more like an offwidth than a true chimney and facing toward town gives you more options.  While the chimney is much more enjoyable than Butt Lips on Aries, I would not call it 5.8.  Closer to an honest 5.9, in my opinion. The moves into and through the dihedral were also good. Extras in blue/green alien size come in handy once you hit the dihedral. Sep 14, 2013",

Right side in for the chimney worked alright, Pulling the roof was dirty, do some gardening if you can reach - roof move is almost more chimney in the corner? · TR. Minus the chimney, a fun TR. Placing gear would be really tricky - getting deep in the chimney for a 4 or 5, then running out (?) the flake, then the disappearing seam at the top. · TR. Ilja put it up. We Trd it. Would’ve been a scary lead for me in the chimney but so fun on TR · Follow. surprisingly fun. near top, can head up and slightly left to an anchor rather than traversing right towards stem and valleys anchor. · TR. Right side in to the chimney. Reach far inside to find the rail. Pulling the roof is tenuous. Get feet high and trust them. · TR. We TR’d this off the RR anchors but the higher anchors would’ve been better. I had some swing potential then set a high redirect for Paul. Awesome climb all the way! Hand jams low. Chimney was cruiser with right side in, R foot in constrictions, RH rail, LH arete. Would want a 5! Weird X cracks the roof. Def would want microcams but tons of high feet, really solid. · Lead / Onsight. Challenging. Two cruxes? Upper crux felt insecure on tiny tips and foot friction. Gear: tiny to 5”, doubles .1-.5. Nuts. Slings. · TR. so many different crack widths. very cryptic but probably still 5.9 if you know all the moves · Lead / Onsight. Cool route. A little odd on the meander, and a little tenuous at the v-slot, but plenty of fun moves (NZ) · Lead / Fell/Hung. Bring 3x0.75 or use 2 at start, bump one high & ext, back clean 2nd. Chim wet at top, bump 2#4 & 1x#5 but 2x#5 better, back cleaned 2nd #4 never replaced. 2x#1 1x#2 1x#3 1x0.3 0.2/0.3 offset bumped 2x black tots a few times, bring more 0.2's. Hung @ roof · Lead / Fell/Hung. grabbed a cam theough the thin section need at least 3 or 4 tcus min without needing to backclean · Lead / Onsight. heady. places a blue alien and 0 mastercam under the roof"

Went right at the crux, pulling the top in the crack was tricky · Lead / Fell/Hung. fell once at crux. plug 0.4 at highest stance, then simply reach up high with right hand, thumbs-down jam · TR. crimp with left, bump left foot to face feature, bump left out further, right foot up to inside of large knob · Lead / Fell/Hung. x2 TR x2 lead. 1, 0, .1, .2, .3, .4., .5 · TR. At the top exiting to the left, left foot in the crack, hands high below the horizontal seam, bump left to further crimp. Right foot high on the nubbin and stand up · Lead / Fell/Hung. fell once at crux, took once to place better gear. tricky at the top and awesome!"

The rest is easy · Lead / Onsight. Super fun. Burly start. Had “stick clip” Loved the airy stem at the top! · Lead / Onsight. First legit 10a/b at Index. Very committing start, weird moves in the middle, eats a lot of smaller pieces. Ending is easy face climbing. Take 3x of #.2-#.5. · Lead / Redpoint. Gear beta: used (removed some other for drag/to use later): Ballnut smallest, 0.2, 0.3 (2), 0.4 (2), 0.75, 1, nuts, many alpines Felt pretty good, used prior beta. · TR. Such a rad climb. Exit Crux by reaching out to jug right and hand jams in crack left - pay attention to feet under first roof. Roofs all go on locks. · Lead / Redpoint. Such a good climb. 2nd time on it, struggled a lot the first time getting out of the layback and around the mini roof. Felt great coming back to it · TR. Still beat up from the winds and fumbled the lead. Ended up just doing some TR. 4 0.3s and 3 0.2s for the lead was nice. Layback layback, 2 hand jams (go for thumbs up), then when getting to the small roof (before roof with hand jam) do right hand in thumbs up under and then left hand thumbs up above. · 2 pitches. Lead. w/Genevieve. Wayyy too hot! 3x0.3 useful. Dump 2x0.4 on layback.Find good finger lock at end of layback start. Stem through scrunchy roof and use hold on right · TR. What the actual fuck on the difficulty of this. It would be better rated as 5.10d. Jacob Yang led it, and I top-roped. Crux is early, maybe 20' up. The pitch goes on forever though, and the upper half eases and has some stunningly cool moves!!! · Lead / Redpoint. excellent climbing, had to get creative when i ran a bit low on gear at the top. With Max!! · Lead / Redpoint. .5 at the top, last right hand finger lock high,full lock off to left flared hand jam, hike feet, then can gain the good hold out right. · Lead / Fell/Hung. I finally talked myself into leading this climb. I had one take at the crux:(. But overall felt pretty good. Used gear from .2-2, triples of .2-.4 helpful (could’ve even used 4 X .3). · Lead / Fell/Hung. Needed some additional small gear. Extra 0.2s and 0.3s next time. · Lead. I remember doing this long time ago felt good to come back and have some fun on it · Lead. Lowered after the first roof cuz I thought I was gonna puke. Rack up left side heavy with .3 for the starting lieback · TR. Lu and I did a couple laps each after another climber graciously offered to put our rope up. Flashed on TR on second attempt. Don’t miss the great right hand jug after the first 20 feet or so. Possible lead? · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung in the start x 2. Pumpy, excited to get back on it. Loved the entire thing. · Lead / Fell/Hung. After leading it and comparing it to other climbs I’ve done like tatoosh, thin fingers, perfect pitch I really do think this climb is 10c. In no way is it 10a. Bo struggled on this while he crushed the other b and d climbs · TR. Clean TR, Soaking wet before final stemmy roof thing. Keep feet low on lieback when leading. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Excellent climb, foot popped on the low crack to miss the onsight. Fun questing on upper section · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 hang near top of layback. Otherwise clean to plum pudding anchors, was a bit too wet for my taste above. · TR. Probably harder than Folsom blues, tr cleanly with a spicy slab traverse. Would try to lead next time · Lead / Redpoint. Good fun, sustained. Fell low down just after the starting layback because I missed a big face hold, but I think moving into the stem up higher is harder. Maybe just because it was wet up top tho · TR. TR bottom section off the PP anchors. Figured out the beta in the roof. Reach around left to get a finger lock thumbs down with the right hand. Press down on the rail out left with left hand to mantle/hand-foot match with left foot on rail. In bottom section, beware the layback with foot blowing off right as the layback gets vertical. Need to press extra hard to stick, and then don’t give up when getting to the flaring spot! Reach high to get a flaring hand jam, but don’t get too crunched up right there with the feet in tight to the body. · Follow. Followed Eric up this sustained 10b and hanged at the lower crux to get a belay tool tossed up to me. Amazed I could climb it having not climbed in several years. Good fun · Lead / Redpoint. Led with 2nd cam preplaced. Notes for myself: left hand deep in the crack.o Miura shoues work great. 2nd crux work with mantle, black totem in a crack. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Take again after the layback transition to hand jam. Notes for myself: No need #2, #3. #0.3 at the beginning, yellow TCU near the top of layback. Reach for good handjam, no gear needed. · TR. Followed Micah’s lead on this today. Sick route! Was juiced on the layback & slipped loosing the TRonsight lol but the rest was wicked fun! The top roof was the best, transitioning layback to stem was dope, then the first mini roof had such interesting movement, I find this difficult for a 10b but maybe I’m a bad climber lol… · TR. TRed bottom half from Plum Pudding anchors. Felt solid except the move to traverse left to Plum Pudding anchor · Lead / Fell/Hung. One take down low on layback section where it shifts to flaring hands, one fall at first mini roof where foot slipped and then I wasn’t going to be able to recover. Gear roughly appropriate: double rack 0.2 to 1, single #2. Save a 0.2 for right before the second roof. Bring extra alpines for nuts. Placing a small cam (black totem?) right before the first mini roof is worth it (fell on extended 0.75 in the crack in back which took me for a ride). In first mini roof, used the right side of the block as well (felt okay) in order to get the feet up onto the left face holds/feet. Theresa did not use that beta but looked smooth. · Follow. multiple cruxes, thin finger crack near the bottom, two bouldering cruxes getting over and on top of some blocky rock · TR. Top roped first half from the Plum Pudding anchor. Redpoint. Trying again with different beta (layback the start). Swiss guys said the roof we didn’t do was all jugs. · Lead / Fell/Hung. .4, yellow tcu then orange tcu for beginning. One #1, 2, .5, .75, 3. Blue tcu and 2 .3s also used. .2 at top! · TR. Very hard with multiple crux’s, take tons of gear all the way up. · doubles 0.3-2 with extra 0.3-0.4 (set of offsets to complement doubles). Crux is layback fingers on bottom (0.4 fit best). Climbing eases off after that. Awesome route! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell a couple times, hung a bit, especially down low. Felt safe · Lead / Onsight. Very fun!!! Awkward moves down low but really interesting climbing up high"

While maybe a .12 somewhere else, I think 11d is very fair for Index and none of the 3 boulder problems feel harder than V4. As of now, after the last bolt, the thin crack running along the final slabby corner to the chains cannot be protected until the dirt gets cleared out. When it is cleared out, a small brass offset or a red (maybe yellow) ballnut should easily protect the insecure move to get established into the corner. A fall after the last bolt, however, is unlikely if you've managed to get that far. I'm pretty sure you need a 70m rope to get off, there didn't seem to be too much excess rope after I rapped which makes me think this pitch is around 32m or so.

Just as amazing as it’s neighbor. Wow. Flake start to fun traverse to tenuous finger crack w slippery slab to multiple big moves thru the roofs.

This pitch features excellent arete climbing, and some cool bouldery sequences. A very good line!Plenty of ways to skin this cat, but here's how we originally climbed it:1. Climb Cry Baby2. Clip bolt, step around left to other side of arete3. Climb easier terrain on the left side of the arete for another bolt or two.4. Step right back around the arete when you can stand on the pretty good footholds on the right face.5. Layback the right side of the arete to the big jug at the top.I've heard  that folks have tried it staying  on the right side the whole way... That would be quite a bit harder. Not even going to hazard a guess at the grade for that.Two notes:1.) easily toproped from the anchor of 12 Gauge, or probably BCB. Incidentally, also a good way to get the rope onto the anchor of either of those climbs (though perhaps harder than 12 Gauge).2.) Do be careful with the rope when you step left around the arete. The climbing out there is much easier than the rest of the pitch, so you probably won't fall.

        "route_description": "This version of Free at Last from the new guidebook is a bit of a rework that combines pitches from the original full Tatoosh, Free at Last, and Voyage of the Majestic Glass Eyed Tuna.  This route is packed from top to bottom with varied, thought provoking crack climbing that will force you to pull on your thinking cap.Pitch 1 (5.10b, 35m):Start up the modern version of Tatoosh (well documented here:mountainproject.com/route/1…).  Instead of belaying at the normal anchor for Tatoosh under a large perched block, continue up 10 feet of dirty terrain and belay off a tree.  Alternatively, split off about half way up, climb up the original pitch two of Tatoosh and belay at the anchors of WATWB/Just Say NO2.Pitch 2 (5.9, 35 meters):This pitch is the lowest quality on the route due to some mandatory dirt scrambling, but it still has a good bit of fun crack climbing.  Head up a clean, low angle V-slot, with a thin crack in the back.  Hike up some dirt and climb some creative sequences up cracks in the corner to the next belay.Pitch 3 (5.10b, 35m):This pitch has quite a few cruxes and felt more sustained than pitch 4, but it's all there.  Begin by heading up the corner to the first crux at the obvious roof.  This is definitely harder than 10b if you opt to burl through it, but there are some sneaky tricks to it.  A good stance above the roof separates the next crux, which will require even more creative thinking.  Once at the base of the overhanging ice cream cone feature, head up and left to the third smeary slab crux, protected by a bolt, and finally up and right along an easy ramp to the belay.Pitch 4 (5.10d, 30m):Just when you are getting used to the funky crack movement, this pitch slaps you in the face with some hard face climbing past two bolts.  We were a little confused by the bolt placements here.  Start by mantling into a little boxy ledge and clip the first bolt, then climb straight left to a blocky crack.  I placed a red metolius here to protect against a pendulum as I moved up to the next bolt, then reached down and pulled it out after clipping.  Continue up to a right leaning crack and then to the base of the imposing V-slot.  This slot is the real money climbing of the route, but I would HIGHLY recommend taping up to get the most enjoyment out of it.  At the top of the slot, clip a bolt and make a few last moves up and right to the chains.  Give your thanks to Saint Francis before heading down!Descent:Rappel the route with a 70 meter rope.  It works best to use the anchor of WATWB/Just Say NO2 for the last rappel, which is climber's right of the couple trees at the top of the first pitch.  The rappel getting there is a rope stretcher.",

May or may not have cheated on a draw for pitch 3 slab crux. Powered my way through roof of pitch 3, not sure what the tricks that were mentioned are · Lead / Onsight. Fourth pitch off the belay I’m told you can start from the gully on the left and traverse and not crack that’s easier. If i do use the bolt up and right and then step left, stay very low all the way down to the low Bigfoot and transition to the crack Where you can climb up and get some good cams before the crocs steep moves just above which all go pretty well if you just keep moving. · Lead. Led Tatoosh and P3. Pulled on the draw thru slab crux of p3. P 4 has a weird traverse start, and the topout slab is tricky too. Doubles tips to #3, single #4. Triples .5, .75 camalot. · Lead / Onsight. Dirty but fun deserved to be done once last pitch have some funky bolt placements. Did with no tape shorts and no shirt no blood was spilled · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on last pitch. Popped off crimp by first bolt and nothing but a bunch of bloody knuckles to show for it. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took even pitches, couldn't get through the beginning of p4 without hanging. · Started with quarry crack for P1. Led P1 and P3, Dan led P2 and P4. Very fun, P4 is hard. Double rack + #4 · 3 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Used Quarry Crack for P1. Lead p2/4. p2 would benefit from more traffic, but all were fun pitches. agree on confusion on p4 bolt placement; fell and re-started the pitch and got clean. w/ Marius · Lead / Onsight. led 2 and 4. Did the leftmost variant on p4. Final splitter corner was fun, but not as epic as the guidebook picture made it look · Lead. Sort of an annoyingly fun route. Fun when the climbing is great and when you overcome some of the tricky wird sections of the route but annoying when your mid way through shitting your pants by the runout and the bad fall potential that you are now faced with. Seriously, half of these bolts are placed so awkwardly with no rhyme or reason at all. 1st pitch (tatoosh) was a blast with some fun crack interspersed with delicate section of insecure climbing. 2nd pitch was ok and got better the further you climbed. 3rd was tricky with a couple distinct crux moves. I fell getting over the roof (1st ever trad fall. Yay!) but managed to work out the slaby crux sequence up above ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯. 4th pitch got me annoyed by the bolt placemat and had to hang on the second draw to clip but the rest of the pitch was Fantastic with another weird placed bolt at the top. · Follow. Fell many times, pulled on gear. Clean lead on pitch 2. Questionable to say I ‘climbed’ this but I did get to the top of it · Lead / Fell/Hung. Pitch 2 and 3 are great. Pitch 4 was rough, french freed the crap out of it · Lead / Fell/Hung. 5:10 base-to-base with Waiwai. Waiwai led P1+3, I lead P2+4. Only P2 sent on lead and P1+3+4 followed clean. The roof on P3 and the V-slot on P4 felt so mega. · Lead. Led P1 and P3. Clean P1. Took P3 roof. use the right hand rail and stem. P4 is good. I followed P4 and did it clean. · Lead. Flare on P2 was more spicy than I'd remembered (maybe cause the crack had a lot of dirt?). Blew the P3 slab move = sadness. P4 was so tough, glad I had ball nuts to cheat. Sun was hot! (TM) · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led 3 and 4 with Kenn. Next time would belay off the tree below the last pitch and skip the PoR bolted weirdness · Lead / Fell/Hung. hung on last pitch trying to figure out how to get over. hard · 3 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Led P1 and P3. P2 is low quality, bailed on the weird and heady P4. Could have used triples in the small cams to 1 for Tatoosh. · 3 pitches. Follow. Followed Jacob. P3 is burly. We both aided through the first section of P4– difficult! · Lead / Onsight. Had a great time with Jess and kye. Led the 9 and 10d. Fun and funky · 2 pitches. Lead. 2 pitches after Tatoosh and finished via VOTMGET as P4. Led all pitches. · Lead / Onsight. Lead quarry crack to free at last. Lead pitch 3 of FAL. Followed pitches 2 and 4 clean. · Lead / Redpoint. With Dan. Fall at 1st roof of P3. Lowered and sent 2nd go. P3 felt harder than P4. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Follow 1&2, OS P3, Hung on ramp on P4, finishing hand crack is awesome. P3 is dope. W Steve · 3 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on the 3rd pitch and bailed at the top because of sunset. · Lead / Onsight. Lead pitches 1 and 3. Took the finger crack variation at the 4th pitch · Lead. Led 2nd and 4th pitch. with TJ. tried to find a walk off. ended up rapping. · Lead / Fell/Hung. W/ Tyler. Lead P2 and P4, which kicked my butt! Amazing pitches though. · Lead / Flash. Led the 10b pitch (fun!). SA led/aided the 10d crux (SA) · Lead / Onsight. W/ Ezra. Bailed off bail biner on pitch 4, seemed sketch. Bummed to miss out on final corner will have to recon"

Then traverse right past one anchor to the anchor at the top of P2 of NAD. It is possible to link with the first pitch if you manage your rope drag well.Note: There are many other ways to reach this point. I’ll describe a couple more recommended variations.Option A: Climb Shirley (5.11) and traverse to the top of P1 NAD then climb P2 NAD (awesome 5.10). This is the most recommended variation as it tags the classic, under-appreciated P2 of NAD.Option B: Climb Thin fingers (or Tatoosh or Quarry Crack) for P1. Then make a moderate traverse clipping strange glue ins to the belay atop P2 of NAD.Pitch 3 80’ 5.10d“P3 NAD”Climb the awesome techy right facing corner up to an athletic roof. Good hand jams take you out the wild roof into a short awkward but easy fist crack. This leads to an hanging belay in the flare above. If you have the energy, it is possible to link into the short next pitch.Pitch 4 40’ 5.10“The Cleft”Head up easy chimney to the roof, then make an awkward transition into the OW on the face above. Solid and friendly splitter 5’s takes you to a sick belay on top of Narrow Arrow. You can get a BD .1 in just before the roof to back up the 5 as you bump it the rest of the pitch. A single 5 allows for TR pro the whole way.It is possible to rap from here with a single 60M rope. One long rappel takes you back to the top of NAD P2, then two more from there to the ground. If descending this way it’s definitely worthwhile to climb P2 of NAD on the way down if you didn’t climb it on the way up.Pitch 5 120’ 5.10aClimb “Higher Learning” to a belay below the last pitch of “Free at Last”. This pitch is a bit mungy but would clean up and likely stay pretty clean if it got some traffic.Pitch 6 80’ 5.10d“Voyage of the Majestic Glass-Eyed Tuna”Head up to near a tree, using a thin crack to head up and right into an obvious left facing corner, follow this amazing splitter to the top of LTW! Alternatively, you can climb the bolted direct start of “The Path of Righteousness” to gain the same corner crack. From here you can rappel or top out and continue up the mid walls Squamish Style.",

If you rap from there (L side while in Rappel) you can sort of climb towards the anchor. If doing this extend belay device and use hollow block (your other prusik was too long) a piece of gear in crux of thin fingers (.75) could help you traverse and gain the handhold (.5 or .4). The actual climb is really fun, crux is at the top for sure, I fell both times but then got it each time. I think i could get the movement dialed down, would be curious to try again and assess gear placements. Also notably, two anchors directly to the left from here. What are they above? TR? · TR. Got to chains somehow. Not sure how I would link all the moves on lead yet. Need a couple more top rope burns to feel comfortable · Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to take below the crux because the holds were all wet and needed to figure out some alternative beta…. But sent the crux no falls!!! · Lead / Redpoint. Ended up putting a blue totem, red dragonfly, 0 z4, and maybe even a .2 C4 (?) through crux. All crux gear on left side of harness · TR. Not to hard until final stem plan on placing a couple smaller cams and firing to top. Best stemmed direct with left foot going high first when it gets really hard. Left hand on corner to pull right foot up. · Lead / Fell/Hung. W Andrew. Sooo sick. Whipped on orange metolious and it blew but the purple BD #5 nut right next to it held. Placed both red ballnuts and whipped on one of them -it held. Could not figure out the sequence for the life of me on the lead burn. But gear is good all the way. Next time, just save purple totem, purple nut, and a couple ballnuts and maybe microcama and a blue totem for the very top and the crux will be sewn up to heaven. Yeeeet. And don’t forget to not be a pussy. · TR. TR with Andrew after lead burn. Got it clean pretty easily haha. It’s all in the head. Just keep stemming slowly and surely. Trusting the feet. It’s even kind of restful just really insecure feeling but trust the sticky rubber and you will send! Leaning far right and palming right hand far right and left hand leaning on the arete in your face to get high left foot. Right foot along the bottoms edge of the seem. Slowly but SURELY. it will go. · Lead. Semi-blind blue/yellow metolius to sew up the crux. Standard rack tips to twos. · TR. Bring a 3 to place before roof. At the undercling roof and good stance, place a blue totem in top of left crack AND a .1 a few feet higher. You need the bottom of the blue totem crack for your left foot. Run it out to the last jug hold. There’s a good .2 placement at the left hand pinky jam, but cannot find a good stance. Wide wide stemming works best. For the top out moves use the two left side pull crimps · TR. Climbed clean on Tr. Crux crack takes 0s, 0.1s and 0.2s. But placing gear would be extremely pumpy. Don’t forget decent rh crimp just before the end of the crux · Lead / Redpoint. First time back on this route this season, felt desperate but I just kept stemming and somehow got through the top crux. Might be my proudest red point this summer! · Per hard climber, can set up TR on this from thing fingers. Other TR on this wall from Warren B, maybe a cia Ferrata? Walk past thing fingers hike up and eventually take a left to go up above…? · Lead / Redpoint. Wrong date. Finally got clean after far more attempts than expected. .2 protects the crux much better than purple metolius. Black totem does not fit · Lead / Redpoint. Felt dialed! With Simon Connor and Jonathan skipped the last black totem placement · 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Second go of the day, broke my red dragonfly on my first RIP. Two purple metoliouses put it down the next time around though · 2 pitches. TR. Struggle bus - couldn't do crux stem moves. Narrow stem traps, wide stem too wide. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Bring a 3 for just before Crux sequence. Crux gear: black totem, then lots of small gear: .1, 0, etc. try a .5 in flaring thing? Another black totem on far left after crux? Red ball nut? Nuts not great · TR. Got a TR set up and managed to place gear clean on TR solo will have to lead when I can get a catch · Lead / Fell/Hung. Whipped big on a purple metolius, coming back for the redpoint · Lead / Fell/Hung. Wow whipped a good bit at the crux yellow alien at the crux and smaller · TR. About 2-3 moves away. Can’t figure out how to get left foot above roof · Lead / Fell/Hung. Was the strongest climber in all of index before the crux · Lead / Fell/Hung. took the whip on a real onsight attempt. doubles to 1 with nuts was good. liberally placing 1 / .75 since there are not so many useful placements for them. Blue totem and largest offset brassie are very good back up gear for crux. High purple metolius (.2 better? black totem does not fit) protects the actual moves. Beta: bump feet up for high right hand lock (not great). Bump left foot into crack to get right foot onto ledge. Left foot onto next bump and then stand up tall for right hand lock. Chimney / shuffle here until reaching crimp out right. Maybe another placement here before topping out, but I'm not sure. · Lead / Redpoint. Finally sent it this time! Third time's the charm. w/ Marius · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard right after the little roof in the stem. Really get that right palm press and right foot out. Move weight back and forth to bump feet and hand · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. one fall, same spot as last time-ish. + 1 TR lap. · Lead / Fell/Hung. slipped! rad, whole body pump. fiddly and not %1000 gear. but it hold. · TR. crux is really hard, didn't have enough hip flexibility and had to get a power belay for a couple moves. Great route though, no falls till stem crux · Lead / Fell/Hung. w/giacomo+roman. only one fall! ballnuts were clutch, placed red & gold ahead of crux · Lead / Fell/Hung. Whipped onto my brass nuts. Gotta have more juice in the calves to get through stem · TR. Clean 1st try, fell at crux on 2nd lap, took short break and got it clean again on 3rd lap · Lead / Redpoint. With Mallorie. 5 TR laps, 3rd lead go. Climbing through the crux when the train was passing made for the quintessential Index experience. · TR. fun and chill until crux. good gear to be had in left crack, stem lots · 2 pitches. TR. With Brandon. Mock led x 2, 1 hang 1st go, clean 2nd go. · Lead / Redpoint. Black x2 Blue x2 Yellow x2 Purple x2 Green Red RP Draws x9 · Lead / Redpoint. Stiff shoes help. Happy to not slip off the top! 5.11 mileage day: Apologies to Shirley and her Natural Dik Garden. · Lead / Redpoint. day flash two years later. glad I didn't take the big whip. placed a .1 and a peanut (mega bomber gear below them too), then yellow totem (pretty bomber) at the bulge and a grey metolious for good measure(pretty decent) and then ran to the chains. just keep climbing · TR. First part, I thought I could lead, then got to stem and say nevermind! I will get better at stem · Lead / Redpoint. With Matt - w/ helium birthday balloon assist [BH: orange trango lobes, next morning] · Lead / Fell/Hung. With Matt - so much fun, cleanly whipped on blue offnut and lil purp BD [BH recon] · TR. with Aaron. did all the moves! keep wide stem..press with left at crux to move left foot over bulge. moved rope over from thin fingers · Lead / Redpoint. Crux crack takes microcams well (#0 or .1 Z4, purple/grey Metolius). Do yourself a favor and leave the ballnuts at home. · TR. with Adam Jackie and James. stemming and pressing. good did all the moves · TR. Slipped at the crux, which the crux is very strenuous. I can't imagine having to lead this and place gear · Lead / Fell/Hung. Aw man the ol one hang! So so fun. Better gear than expected · TR. Really fun!!! Super tricky dihedral moves near the top rest was pretty chill · TR. my first ever top rope solo. hard friction stemming section at the end · Lead / Redpoint. Fiddled way too much with gear - just go for it · Lead / Fell/Hung. On that purple C3 at the crux. Only one fall though · Lead / Redpoint. Takes a perfect brassy and offset right below the crux. From there stim as your life depended on it · TR. Made it to the top. A couple falls at the bulge crux, got the moves figured out."

This route used to be called Free at Last, now it's just Tatoosh. If instead of going up the dihedral, you break right half way up and head up the offwidth, it links into P2 of the original Tatoosh route(4 pitches long, goes all way the to the top of the wall). There's fun climbing on the original Tatoosh, really fun actually. I tried to clean it up a few years ago, but it was a FUNNEL of debris.

Best it has felt but still room to improve · TR. felt good. No #3s and doubles to #.75. Did back to left but partner did to right on the chimney section. · TR. Took a couple times, super fun climb, worth getting on. Getting first clip is fcked… Myles had Adarsh swing over when lowering for it… · Lead / Fell/Hung. Save a black totem for the top. Works great as a last piece and don’t need to fiddle with a .75 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Almost made it through the crux. Got pumped trying to finger jam. Better to just try to stand up in a stem. Good ring lock in the .75 crack before the finish, and great hand jam right above anchor · Lead / Onsight. Superb climbing. Varied, mostly fingers. Good rests, series of short fun cruxes. · Lead / Fell/Hung. took on the upper crux section to manage pump. few things i did better: -instead of laybacking the start, crack climb it to good crimps - upper section has really good stemming rest, and the jug is trustable. with those two rests the upper section is actually pretty straightforward if you go out and left to hand holds— my first fall i believe i tried to stay right · Follow. Post rain in the morning, felt a bit slick even though dry. Humid out. · Lead / Redpoint. Brought trips of .2 and .3, doubles of .4-1, one 2. Three double slings, three singles, a couple of draws. Didn’t use nuts. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Felt hard! Chimney section too thin, lean right to get to bigger section. Save a single rack 0.3-0.6 for the top. Leave the 2s on the ground. · Lead / Redpoint. Hell Yeah! Sent this baby today. Start is still fucking hard but I figured out the chimney and the top was physical but good. Gear is spot on but being 6 slings. Don’t really need nuts if you have all the extra cams. · Lead / Redpoint. Hot girls hammer out their nuts with two carabiners in the fading twilight (no headlamp, no nut tool). #nogearleftbehind #nogirlleftbehind W Eric (twin) · Lead / Onsight. A bit desperate for 10b! Wishing I had brought 3 .3s · Lead / Fell/Hung. Heady great introduction to 10b trad for me. Rested 2 times, planning on coming back soon for the red point · TR. Did it clean but felt some rope tension on the chimney. This pitch is fucking hard. 10b no way. For an onsight attempt for a non-Index local I’d say maybe 11b/c??? Gear singles tiny - 2, doubles .5-1, triples .3-.75, nuts, slings, couple draws. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got my ass kicked. Was tired from DHLA the day prior and other stuff before that. Just couldn’t see the movement without falling and didn’t want to fall. Aided and climbed my way up in order to set a TR. · TR. 2 burns. Good crimps in the corner, use right stem out to gain high crimp with left foot jam. Layback steps are okay. Upper part walk feet up flake on right before bumping to high left hand jug. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led and did a second lap on TR. Used trips of .2s, .3s, doubles of .5, .75, one .4, 1, 2 and gold offset. · Lead / Onsight. Felt slightly harder than Thin Fingers the way I did it · Lead / Onsight. Stick clipped the first bolt. Nice climbing but a little nervous with placing gear through the thinner areas · Lead / Fell/Hung. Climbed with Kat. Fell to the first bolt sent the rest of the pitch. Excited to get to come back this route is so fun! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Been wanting to climb this for ages. Fell halfway up on top finger crack. Stick clip for bottom bolt was nice to have, avoided a blind/shallow gear placement at start · Follow. Got shut down at the bolt at the start. Felt so hard. Pumpy bro fest, not particularly interesting or inspiring. Some cool finger moves · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell once at top after lieback. Pumped. Fun. Fingers corners. Chimney and stemming moves too. Some ledgeds along the way. Heavy on .2 to .5. Felt fun to be near my max and take a fall. Though I sort of gave up after having the thoguht that I wouldnt have the strength to finish. · TR. Send! Felt much easier this time. At midway fork, took dirty route left of splitter finger crack. Think it was harder this way. · Lead / Fell/Hung. With Chelsea and Alyssa. Stick clipped the bolt and slipped trying to lie back the opening moves— I think I weighted the rope. Would like to find a more reliable way to do the opening sequence · Follow. Fallon put it up, she thought it was hard and long for 10a. · Lead. popped out of the corner at the start and grunted my way up the rest. easier than it looks from the ground but not exactly great for first climb out of the car · Lead / Redpoint. first 10 in index lets goooo!! couldn’t remember shit from my TR last summer, did in full sun feeling like shit and anxious as hell about all the things going on in life. But, i ripped it good and got to rope gun for Tristan and Simi! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Left arm pumped out at top, should go easy if I warm up · TR. Clean TR, led by Jacob. Didn’t clean all gear. Bottom boulder problem went with straight in jamming, get feet high carefully and weight them. · Lead / Redpoint. Sent first go this time! Totally forgot about the crucial foothold near the top, sent anyway. Laybacks feeling better · Lead. Overall climbed well. Spending way too much time faffing with gear. Start with smaller sizes than bigger. Equalizing the pin and nut. The .75 offset. Climb one extra move before placing again. Like ice. At the end rest in the stem don’t try to clip high good jams above ledge · Lead / Fell/Hung. 2 takes, one because it's wet, one because I was pumped at the top · TR. One of the best 5.10 trad routes I’ve ever been on! Soooo good, varied, long and fun. Would like to try to lead. TR w no hangs · TR. Almost had it clean on top rope. Messed up the final sequence at the top. Will be back to try to lead it · Lead / Fell/Hung. With Claire. Wtf is that start... got the rest clean. Nothing above 1\" · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung at bolt, at first layback crux (and then did some moves above 0.2), and again at upper crux a number of times and fell on the #2 in the pod at the upper half crux. Brought nuts (used like 4x) and 0.2-2 with double 0.3-2 and triple 0.75 (since I didn’t have triple of smaller). So sustained and tough, but gets progressively easier. Full 35m pitch. Never found a spot for the #3, don’t bring it. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 100% stick clip the bolt, and use a true 70m rope. Single 3, doubles 1, triples (0.3-0.75) 8 Alpine draws. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Laybacking is my kryptonite. Felt better on the second go, would have liked to give it another proper try but ran out of daylight · Lead. Had someone kindly offer to clip the bolt for me when they were TR soloing the route next door. Good thing too bc I fell right below it. Lowered and onsighted the rest of the climb after that. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Climbed with Cameron - the final move I got pumped and took but excited to come back and climb this amazing route again · Lead / Fell/Hung. Finally led this baby, one hung 3ft from the chains, will send next time when I’m more rested · Lead / Fell/Hung. Doubles to 2 with extra small pieces (0.2-0.5) to use at the top. R foot heel jam at base, kick out right to swoop, keep the stem as long as possible until the crimp jug · TR. Solo top rope, thanks Luke for fixing my rope up there, and Anthony for letting me borrow his camp lift. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took a lead fall on a #3 right before the bolt. Shoe rubber is so slick at 37degrees! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Made it to the final section before falling. Sent the chimney and start bolt. Placed NINE pieces in the final finger crack (out of 14 total)… really need to work on the enduro and gear beta for that. It will go eventually."

        "route_tick_comments": "· Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at the top lieback crack. Too pumped to commit up · TR. Fell on the slab crux 4 times and once transitioning into the layback after, amazing full value pitch · Lead / Fell/Hung. fell once on seam move and once on layback bc of pump / gas. exhausting though, took a long time in general. · TR. Beautiful climbing, hard sequences. Fell twice at crux. Slipped out at lieback into swim crack.. fell getting into lieback bulge part? And during that part.. soooooo pumped.. only got to the top by bribing myself with a Zekes milkshake. Great climb · TR. My short person beta for the slab crux: right hand get 2 fingers (half pads?) on the little side crimp. Left foot on lower crimp. Jump up to get high enough to desperately get fingers into the crack. Right foot up to nipple crimp. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Another classic index trickiness. Superb hand crack up there but the cruxes above ledges didn't inspire much confidence in me. Took several times. · TR. Super cool pitch. At weird thing crack, go right, left foot out wide to knub, left hand on crimp edge, pull around into left foot matching right hand. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on top of lower pitch again tricky slab move off yellow totem For crux place small bras nut. found a way to step from right onto big foot using left crimp and then up right hand to sloper. Once positioned can reach edges. Didn’t pull it clean but lighter and more fit could. · Lead. Practice Letty’s slab beta next time- use further right side pull (?) hold, left foot to slab edge · TR. Tried far left of slab don’t think it goes. Couldn’t get feet to stick going straight up. Almost lost tension lay backing in from the right, get that tight. P.86 rock warriors way · Lead / Fell/Hung. Aided through the crux, & fell once in the lower crux because of slipping on sand. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell twice on slab. Once on layback. Another take up high. · Lead / Fell/Hung. really amazing climbing throughout with a typical one move wonder index trickery slab crux. bailed right and still couldn’t free the slab. fought hard in the upper half to such an exciting finish! · TR. Managed to pull off the slab crux on Tr! High rf to good foot. Bump rh up arete and lh up thin crack to balance. Stand and reach for rh crimp · TR. Fell once at the lie back. Beta for crux: Left hand low crimp on face, right hand around arete, left foot low crimp. Move right foot up to higher low crimp, move left foot up to big crimp on right side of face, left fingers in teeny tiny crack and move up · Follow. 11/10 maybe best pitch of climbing ive ever touched?? cruxes for me were the bouldery seam section, pulling the overhang into handcrack, and managing fatigue through the handcrack and upper layback crux · Lead / Redpoint. Did the slab crux today yay!! TC Pros ftw. Such a good pitch, the hand crack is so sick! · TR. For the crux: right hand arete and thumb catch. Left hand on small sidepull down and left of anchor. Step up right foot. Tension, move up left foot to chip. Trust your feet. Stand up, move left hand into crack, and move right foot up to better spot. Stand on that and get your hands in the crack. Crank bad finger locks, and reach for the jug. · Lead. Evening send w ruthtruck. Almost slipped off down low hehe. Rh undercling, lh on some bullshit, lf low, rf high, lf match nearby, stand tall to some holds. Foot sequence might be reversed. · Lead / Onsight. Slab/seam crux took a few attempts to figure out, but easy to step back down to the ledge without weighting the rope. Doubles to #2, plus nuts was plenty. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Does it still count as a fall if you just drop back down to the ledge and your belayer doesn’t catch you? Got some beta for the crux and took 2-3 tries to work it out. Everything else was onsight · Lead / Fell/Hung. Gahhh so good! Felt way stronger on lead than the first try. I climbed through the 5.9 slab and felt very good. Aided through 11a slab and into the 10a crack, the crack felt great compared to last season. But I need to rest in it more. Good rest stance before the lie back. The lie back continues to feel hard and strenuous, though the bottom felt better than last year. There are also small feet on the left, and also could consider keeping right hip in and smearing right foot outside of the crack. Stopped right before topping out on the lie back, came down after falling. Clean fall. Wanna try to just climb through it next time. The bottom finger crack protects with two .3 totems, then yellow TCU, then a gold RPM (not sure which size?), then .3 BD and then .4 totem. Might add a few extra items onto future rack in case I’m missing something. The 5.9 slab protects with two ball nuts (bomber). The 5.11a protects with a gray TCU but I might need to place more pro before that, maybe RPM. I think to climb it clean id have to get the slab (going out to climbers right and back into the crack is too scary of a fall). But getting the 5.11 slab is hard, bring a brush like a dooche bag and try to clean the feet next time. Also getting into the crack from the position feels really hard (protects with .5 and .75). The 5.10a hands protects with 1s and 2s. The lieback protects with a 1 BD and a .75 BD (x2). The very top might take a 3 BD. Need to work the slab and the lie back. Suchhhh an amazing and varied climb. Also for pro- might consider small stuff pre-hung with alpine draws on the front two loops with bigger stuff in back, can re-arrange after 5.9 slab and bring bigger pro to the front. · TR. Climbed with Aaron - figured out the slab section and feels repeatable - ready to lead this bad boy! · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 hang on first lead attempt! Gear: .1, black totem+blue metolius, 3x .3-.75, 2x #1, 1-2x #2. P1: .3, nut or .5, nut, .4 near good lock. Ledge: .3+ yellow dmm offset, black totem couple moves up. R hand reachy lock, L hand pinky down to place black totem. Get L hand to diagonal hold, work feet, R hand cross to slopey hold, R foot in corner and stand up. P2: .1, L foot up slab working into second R hand side pull. Kick R foot into wall, reach up to good left hold. Stand up and reach to place .4. Big move from R hand on upper crimp with R foot on small slopey chip out right, reach L hand pinky down great lock. Place .75 in main crack or .3 ish in R crack. Get to good jam and place #1. Bump #2 or place 2 in the hand crack. Rest. #1, then .75 before good feet run out. Lieback out till L foot chip out left, convert R hand to rattly thumbs down lock, L foot toe jam in flake, then up to jug. Place .4, endure one more sequence. Rest, place blue metolius, up to ledge, then high .75 and finish. · TR. Decent down low to first ledge, use finger jams to next step, couldn't figure out slab Crux, layback to hand jams, more lay back and crimps up high · TR. first crux is finger section 30ft up, good feet just left of the crack. don’t go too high when bypassing the crux (don’t go into ledge), after hand crack, mostly a lie back at 0.5/0.75 size. · 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Onsight first half of p1 to middle anchors !!! Then TRed again for fun · Lead / Fell/Hung. Slab took four attempts, even with pointy shoes. Bring brush next time · Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to pull on ball nut to set feet on high left foot · Lead. I sent? maybe? had a false start on the slab move and slid down onto my rope but also just sort of stepped down. climbing is stupid. this route is awesome and so fun and not really that hard and I will come back and do it again · TR. Couldn’t pull the 11a slab moves. Had to move out right and back left · Lead / Fell/Hung. With Erik and Ryan. Fell at the crux a bunch, but finally figured it out! · TR. TRS. Bottom felt good. Had to ascend through slab. Got it clean on tr yesterday. Trs tension made it harder? Biggest question mark remaining for sure. Upper is just endurance. Roger strong says #3 stopper protects crux · TR. Clean! Slab via the right. Leading still seems wild work the gear see how it feels. · TR. With Bridget and Aaron. On TR it felt similar in grade to Tatoosh. But on lead it’d be a lot harder bc of the second section that’s hard to protect above a ledge. One hung at the top before the anchor. One of the best trad 11’s I’ve gotten on · Lead / Flash. Super fun route with lots on thin moves down low and jams up high. Gear: Small nuts, 3 black totem, 2 blue totem, 0.4, 3x 0.5, 0.75, 3x 1, 2 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Very varied. Wanted my sport shoes over my trad shoes for this crux. · TR. Crux is hard, don't feel like I really figured it out. Ended up going to the big edge around the corner and then balancing my way back on-route, but it felt suspect · Lead / Fell/Hung. Feel twice at the lower half, popped a piece right before the crux. Don't climb if it looks wet · Lead / Redpoint. +2 back to back TR laps. W/ Kaz and Emma partially after dark. · TR. Followed David's gear up. The bottom part was engaging, but I stayed on! The crux above the first chains is really tricky and hard! I tried it several times but eventually resorted to tugging on the draw and stepping on the bolt. The rest of it was awesome!! Remember: once the #1 narrows to #.75, better to layback than jam. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got to above the slab crux then fell, bailed from there after losing my head :(. Save a .2 for the top of the crux, spent wayyyy too long trying to get pro in there and pumped out after getting a solid .5 above. · TR. So hard. The lie back! There is a good finger lock with the right hand after the crux to get to the standing position. The 5.9 slab, do-able, but not a lot of pro. Wondering about a ball nut as a second piece. And also transitioning into the crack if you don’t go up the slab, might feel scary on lead. Could I just stick in a .75 blindly before getting in the crack? I think I could get those moves if I rehearsed it. So sustained and pumpy. Tried the slab, I almost was having more luck out left but then it thins out. There is an undercling on the right arete with a foot to stand up on but this go I wasn’t able to reach the crack. Higher foot? Bump up the hand? Some pro I placed on TR RP Gold nut .3 black totems x2 .4 yellow totem x1 .75 green BD x3 2 yellow BD x 3 1 red BD x1 .5 purple · TR. Got pumped out at the bulge and fell. Had to take the.10a variation to slab hell. · TR. fell many many times. needed to rest more between sections. did 10a variation · Lead. First p at index, wet and only to the first anchor. Great rock · TR. Micah led then TR’d after him. Low crux was hard layback, then next crux was slabby super thin crack. Figured it out but fell trying to figure out how to get into the hand crack. Hand crack was amazing. Then pumped out at upper layback crack. Need to work on the feet through this section to make it less strenuous. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Felt way better than I expected it to. Beautiful movement. The lie back is strenuous to move through with gear- get a couple of ..75/ .5 totems to just plug and chug on the way up? Climbed around the slab for today but would like to work it. Hand crack is soooo good · TR. TRedpoint. Didn’t cheat far out right this time. Should definitely lead it next time"

Fell once at crux. Top lie back crack kicked my butt though. Was struggling to commit and got pumped out multiple times. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Layback was fun with Hasib. Didn’t have confidence. Saw someone else go straight in - interesting! · Lead / Fell/Hung. W Andrew. Was being scaredy pants and pulled on .75 because I was getting pumped and didn’t want to whip. Didn’t have the ideal rack either. Next time: double #1-3 for bottom half, extending every piece fully. Save 1 .5 and all the .75s for the top crack, and maybe a hand piece. AND RUN THROUGH THE CRUX SO YOU DONT GET PUMPED. not hard. Good hand crack higher up. Just send it. · TR. Fell at the face crux a few times. Just gotta commit to the jug. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell trying to place after the crux. You can jam the layback, it’s mostly .75. Bring 3x.5-.75 · Lead / Onsight. Last pitch with Aaron. Nearly pumped out of the crack. I was psyched after. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 0.5 with dl sling, 1 sling, blue sl, 0.5/0.75, 3, bolt, 0.4/0.5, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2. Next time try crossing hands over at crux with right hand furthest left crimp?. Grab crimp with left thumb (Gaston with slight underlying) Need to move r foot before going for sloper jug · Lead / Flash. Great route! A bit soft for the grade, the traverse is quite powerful, but the upper crack was pumpier (laybacked). · Lead / Fell/Hung. 0.75, 1, 3, 0.5 (could do p/g offset or 0.4 instead), 3, bolt. For crack, 0.5 x 2, 0.75, red, yellow. Slings on everything up to traverse. so: 0.4, 0.5x2, 0.75x2, 1x2, 2x2,3x2, 0.4/0.5, 0.5/0.75. · TR. One fall on TR bc I tried to jam the upper crack instead of laybacking. Feels like it would be doable on lead, I'm tall enough that the traverse isn't too bad. Upper layback is definitely the scary part, but I think doable if I can get away with no gear between the ledge and the hand pod. · TR. crux traverse is hard. layback isn't too dramatic. down low is cool. potential project? · Lead / Redpoint. Had to style it again on 1st index day of the year · Lead / Fell/Hung. Broke a hold near the start and fell but other than that pretty good go. Just need to gun it on the lay back · Follow. Holy heck the last 25 feet are pumpy!! ew liebacking. Bolt section traverse is fun! Just a bit reachy but not bad if you know where youre going. · Lead / Redpoint. First try of the day. Almost messed up the traverse which has never happened before - tough piano match saved the day. Loses a star for how dirty the intro is, but otherwise great · Lead / Fell/Hung. hung twice in lieback. triple.75 would be nice. lots of slings · Lead / Onsight. really fun route. the traverse wasn't as bad as it looked. · Lead / Fell/Hung. One take in the layback. Just couldn’t quite make it to the hand jams. Next time, remember to just push a bit further and it eases up. Move fast, place 0.75, move fast, hand jams. · TR. Flailed on this. Face part wasn’t too bad. Upper crack felt pretty unachievable. · TR. Clean! Would still be hard to lead that lieback part, but I actually did it with a bit of juice left, so maybe it would go. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Best attempt. Fell on slab but very clean fall. Got back up and redid the slab + layback. Layback lead went well. Found a bit of rest with .75 thin hand lower than previously · TR. bottom is bouldery old school climbing. felt 10-. would use a bunch of hand sized pieces there. could not figure out the foot traverse. may be worth trying again with fresh forearms. splitter crack was awesome. · TR. Clean TR. time to go back and lead it now roofs felt good this time can clip bolt from top of right side and then go down and rest before traversing traverse felt okay too, just have to trust feet and throw for that left hand (get deeper left hand) need .4 or orange metolius for base of lieback Then .5, .75 and the rest is halfway up, with a hand jam jambacked inner foot felt pretty secure, lieback is definitely strenuous, consider pre-attaching alpine draw to gear to save time · TR. Hung twice: once b/c I didn’t see a good foot on the finger traverse (but the traverse felt pretty solid after) and second on the layback when my foot slipped · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Gear beta .75 low, extend like crazy bring some #2's for the first buldges a #3 is useful for the final bit before the traverse you know the traverse well .4 is good first part of lieback .5s the rest of the lieback #1 for final handcrack (thank god) · TR. Couldn’t step of the slab. Climbed the lie back better the second go. · TR. At crux use low feet, high R on good edge, match crimps, L out on edge, and wrench left shoulder to get to ledge. Layback is pumpy, keep going to handjams. · Lead / Fell/Hung. made it past the first crux on the slab move in the first go. bring lots of green cams 4 I believe in 5 the top which is the hardest part takes the most of them currently the best beta for the feet in the corner is a left foot toe jam and working the right on the smears. The first placement right off the face move is 0.3 cam and it's very helpful to keep your right foot on the facehold that you just left. Left side there's a good nub for your left foot. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 5 .75 3 .5 3 1 plus rack to to 3 · Lead / Redpoint. First try this season, didn’t remember any beta. Fun!! With kaj and quincy. · TR. had some help getting through slab crux, was super hot, rubber melting, and I'm fat and weak. hung once on upper crack. cool route, slap after slab isn't super positive. lower crack had a couple powerful steep bulges to pull · Lead / Redpoint. Forgot a .75 for the top so I did a good run out to the 2 · Lead / Fell/Hung. No problem through the traverse. Fell while pulling up rope to clip fairly low on the crack. Next time keep moving! · Lead / Fell/Hung. aided crux then fewhang through upper dihedral (lieback, don't jam!). 2s and a 3 for the bottom, then .4, .5, .75x2, 1, 2 for the top). try LH gaston crack as an intermediate for the crux next time. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Could redpoint! Reach for bad hold after bolt and trust it. Layback crack. · Lead / Flash. first day back at index for the spring. it was desperate through the bolt and in the layback, but managed to keep it together. climbed pretty tense and scared. · Lead / Flash. Got scared on the 5.9 down climbed it to come back another day and flashed the whole thing freaking stoked!! · Lead / Redpoint. Redpoint. TR'd it a while back. First go. Super fun route · Lead / Redpoint. Redpoint on first lead attempt! Far left feet on traverse. Extended .4, .5, 2 .75s, 1 on layback. · TR. Boulder problem moves very small box, still not sure how to do them right. Upper corner lieback until a bit before the other crack appears. Then, straight in ringlocks for a few moves before transitioning to hand jams."

Well-bolted slab climbing grows in difficulty until a distinct, thin crux section. After the crux, there is a much easier runout either right to an anchor on TPMV below its 10d mantle pitch or to a higher anchor via a dike and easy roof. Natural gear protects the dike and the moves over the roof. The crux of the route is infamous for being rather thin for the grade, especially during the warm season. Descend from the anchor above the roof or better yet continue to the anchor at the top of the TPMV/Japanese Gardens routes via 5.7-5.8 slab climbing for a full size pitch.",

From the anchor at the top of the latter climb, scramble up and right across a grassy ledge to an anchor below the slab.

It's possible that some ascents have climbed to the right after the roof to take advantage of a full rest on Iron Horse before moving back left to establish on the arete; although not totally straightforward, this reduces the difficulty as it allows one to start the easier Powerhorse sequence fully rested and chalked. If climbed directly without the jaunt right into the rest, the moves are harder and the route feels far more sustained. In any case, the climbing is a remarkable mixture of power and finesse, difficult nearly the whole way through. Temperature and humidity are both important considerations when attempting the route even if your granite technique is absolutely flawless.The extension to the original route continues above the anchor over the roof past one bolt to a more logical finish at an anchor on a large ledge. The original anchor has now been moved higher to just under the upper roof, making what was originally a crux section of the extension part of the shorter version. This section is height dependent as it is much easier if one can simply stem across the corner. A small stopper and a finger-size cam protect the final section above the roof.",

Practice falls to first chains. .5 and. 4 protect under roof, place black totem before crux foot swap · 2 pitches. TR. Got it basically clean the second time. Should lead it next time, use a combination of stemming and lay backing for the crux · TR. 2 attempts. Took some time to figure out the beta, but not too bad once you get the moves. Definitely easier to be tall here. · Lead / Redpoint. *********TR to low chains. Lead to the top with pre-hung draws · TR. Short crux: layback to get LF on jug, step left to get RF up high and RH into juggy side pull. LF to good knob, RF toe into lieback pod, place black totem in slot, LH slot, RH pinch undercling, Swap feet, LF good knob, flip LH to under cling, bring RF to another knob · Follow. Got clean today with Nate redon. To first anchor 11.a very hard and a long whip potential at top. Took his whip in 2015 · Lead. Went up and sorted the beta at the top and it made way more sense to got left to the jug earlier with right hand on the basketball, the way climbing up to clip the bolt feels henious and haughty dependent and reaching left feels super natural and in sequence. Ends with a dyno to a jug, pretty sweet. 2 tries this year toproped once a few years ago I think · TR. TRed clean until the crux pull on the slab. Would be a heady lead. · Lead / Redpoint. Two lead goes after some toprope work. Double send day with Numbah 10. First 5.12 post surgery · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard. At 3rd bolt, step rf on good knob, lf stemming. Grab football hold lh and bad knob right hand. Work left foot up on to bad knob then stand on football. I think. I dunno can’t remember quite right · TR. start knob sequence with left foot, get right foot on smear, pull on small crimp, bring left foot up. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took a *big* whip at the crux (rope behind the leg, flipped upside down and all). Proud that I finished it after that. :) · Follow. Near TRonsite of the short version of the first pitch. After climbing through the crux, there's a high left finger slot. The key for me was a right hand middle finger pocket under the rail. · Lead / Redpoint. Just to the low anchors (11a variation). Proud of the lead on this one. Should def come back for the whole thing. Gear beta for crux: double up at the last roof (blue totem and either purple metolius or a blue z4, be sure to put a draw on); don't bother trying to place in the side pull (seriously, it's garbage); black totem at next pocket is bomber. · TR. Really fun! The roof moves are great and then a tricky cross over · TR. DNS.Projected first pitch on top rope; climbed three times to under cling. Felt good to get under cling move eventually. Pumpy-biceps are so sore! Felt good knowing last time I was here I was buckled in fear, but today I jumped right on and gave it a try. · Lead / Redpoint. headpoint no lead falls, kinda botched the lower 11 slab section and got flash pumped but kept it together and styled the 12! · TR. Got the first pitch clean, but couldn't even do the first hard move on the second pitch · 1st p tr. Clean to crux. Fun face moves out left. Need to stay in crack though · TR, def not clean, but it will go one day. Lead will be SCARY"

Didn't need to place any #.75; moves to get into the crack were straightforward. · Lead / Fell/Hung. One fall. Was pooped after leading Sagittarius and TR iron horse. Think this would go otherqise · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took. Super out of shape but a fun route. Felt much harder than it looked · TR. Big jam past tight red hands, start lower and traverse rigjt and use start of marginal karma. Green cam protects start. Move fast past crux · Lead / Redpoint. Tried to avoid going out right too much at the start, used some face holds but' no side pulling MK crack. Also went straight up at the end with a high step and finger lock. 0.4/0.5 Offset, 0.75, 1x2, 2x3, skipped the #3 (had it tho), 0.75 out right (wc or tot better than z4) & 3rd #1 next to it. 0.5x2 in flaring crack above cave, idk why but yel tot was shit and/or blocked my finger jam. · 2 pitches. TR. TRS 2 laps + Rogers crux, no mock lead just directionals. Went pretty straight up off belay both times, hard but doable. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung once after feeling pumped going from thin hands section to hands. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Needed help getting thru the bottom section of thin hands / sooo good and splitter · Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Brian Rajdl. Linked from 5.9 Roger's Corner. This pitch is a bit short, but the position is fantastic 120' off the deck! · Dropped in from the top after going up GNS as a party was lapping Roger’s. Make sure to bring a few cams with you if you want to top it from dropping in so you don’t end up floating in space… · Lead / Onsight. Tight hands at the start was tough but short. Rest was cruiser. Thought this was easier than Roger’s because of the easy gear and short line. Lots of feet on face until crack widens for easy foot jams. Overall Way easier than Libra. · Lead / Onsight. Steep for a 10a. Super burley. Crux at the bottom and top. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung once after struggling to find a place to place a #1 when I only had 1 #2. Definitely bring 2x #2s! Pumpy but is all there. · Follow. Andrew led and took a few times down low. But pushed on and made it to the top. Fun and harder than it looks · Lead / Redpoint. W chad, finally got to get on lead for this one still steep and burly but much more fun now that I know how to jam. · Lead / Onsight. Proud send. A bit heady and challenging. Some face holds and feet at the bottom help with getting sufficient lieback moves to get to the thin hands bit to get a good foot pod. Finger lock out right while standing on the low/first (only?) foot rail helps to rest long enough to launch into the route. Was helpful to have been practicing swimming technique up and down and up and down VW hand crack for endurance. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lowered and had Wren lead the last bit at the top. Followed her up there before rappelling · Lead. Alright Kristina and I split this lead and honestly probably the hardest thing I have led at index. Consistent hand crack to some blocky crack climbing. A couple big moves — don’t be scared of falling into the tree behind you · Lead / Fell/Hung. I am so weak! The crack is lovely but the overhung angle did me in. Took a lot and backcleaned a bit. The big upper move is almost harder. · TR. W/ Gus. Thankfully someone had come over from GNS and followed with our rope so we could top rope. Come back and take no falls and practice hand jams. Very yummy for 10a. Got lowered to the first pitch of Roger’s Corner. Absolutely terrifying, exposure definitely got to me waiting at the anchor and rappelling in the void. · Lead / Onsight. Thought we were on rogers corner but we took the wrong route up to this. Also tried free range chook and whipped on the piton · Lead. Lots of takes, but did the moves cleanly and didn't pull on gear. First few 0.75 moves are hard and overhung. Brought singles 0.3-0.5, triples of 0.75-2, and doubles of #3 · Lead / Onsight. Super fun crack, gets easier the further you go! Doubles 0.75-3. Clean and simple. · Follow. had to aid climb the second half as my fore arms were fried from the lower pitch but fun · Lead / Onsight. fun, committing move off the start of the pitch to a nice stance · Follow. Crux getting off the anchor. Takes a 0.5, then gets wider and wider to a 3. Stay right and walkup to the anchor."

It was a little scruffy when I climbed it, but someone had cleaned it somewhat recently and it was still possible to at least toprope it clean. From the anchor atop Japanese Gardens P2 move left and up to a short, thin crack. Even though I remember thinking some gear might go in before you commit, the business starts without any fanfare and on lead the crack would be a scary, desperate lieback above a ledge with a hard-to-clip bolt near its top. The route then climbs over to and up onto the face of the Stiff Kittens Flake and follows a seam/crack to the top of the flake. I remember this section being low-to-mid-5.10 face climbing and it appeared quite runout. Another option would be to just finish Stiff Kittens, which would omit the worst of the runout. I know that at the top of the flake I stepped left and down and finished on the Stiff Kittens slab, so I don't know if there is an independent finish directly above.

The upper part of the route is pretty runout; I don't remember seeing much potential for gear but it does follow a seam or crack of sorts so there might be something. Another option as stated above would be to climb the rest of Stiff Kittens which has good gear. There may or may not be an independent anchor for Cheeseburgers, but I remember stepping left--again on MiniTraxion so take with a grain of salt--to finish on the upper Stiff Kittens slab.

Hugh Herr, a double amputee who used prosthetics that he designed and fabricated, completed a free ascent. Chris Schlotfeldt completed a pinkpoint ascent (pre-placed gear) in the late 1990s. Mikey Schaeffer made the first redpoint ascent in the contemporary accepted style in 2006, meaning he placed ALL his gear on lead from the ground.

The crack is consistently difficult until it relents at the top, although a left-jogging section above an undercling is particularly challenging.P2: (.10b) The oft-climbed approach pitch to Slow Children can also be accessed via Godzilla. Thin stemming leads to crack and ledgy face climbing and an anchor on a ledge below the initial corner of Slow Children.P3 and P4: Apparently, pitches 3 and 4 of City Park can be free climbed at moderate grades (.10, 5.9+).

Felt sketched out a little today, took on the opening moves and once higher up because I botched the beta. · Lead / Flash. golden dmm offset massively helps low crux protection in seam ~10” below the mini ledge. black totem above ledge to protect pulling it. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Too nervous to commit to the big reach with my hamstring injury · Follow. Tough techy crux right off the belay then eases a lot. Followed Conor, kinda spicy lead I bet · Follow. Didn’t feel like leading this onsight, and Haigh and Brielle showed up so Chase and I followed them up. Bring a gold offset for the crack after the bolt. It’s not too bad once you’re in there. · Follow. Thumb press right and palm arete left to stand up onto balancey left foot. Black totem in first slot, use the next slots for fingers to mantel. Both feet up to decent edge, R foot up to slopey bump, hop L foot up to ledge · Lead / Redpoint. Have got it clean in the past also.

Redpoint cause I fell at the stem crux and had to re-try. Got clean afterward · Lead. Forgot how tough this was off the start, kinda scary but fun. Bring a 3 for up higher, there is a horizontal slot you can place it in out left. · Lead / Redpoint. Had a couple falls onto a brassy at the start, if tall can reach the ledge, if short need to get right finger lock, left foot to rail, right hand up, pull - bump right foot to stem, bump left foot up to small chip, then can reach the rail.

        "route_tick_comments": "· Lead / Fell/Hung. Fist time the beta made sense. Found nearly passive arm bar when shuffling in that makes things much easier. Slightly unsure how to move up from crimp to above roof. Currently chimney with left fort back step, but slightly awkward. · TR. High step crux: R hand pinch/undercling far R, L hand on arete, L foot smears lower than obvious foot, R foot steps through. Flare crux: L foot knee bar, crimp in back of flare L hand, L foot to square chip, R hand chickenwing, shuffle up until can get R foot onto edge in back and stand up to crimp below roof · TR. Sent it on TR. Cold,dry, sunny day, 45 degrees. Getting into the slot and levitating upwards felt great, simple. · Lead / Redpoint. Woohooo! I love this climb. 6 or 7 tries total. Fell at the 3rd bolt on my 3rd try today then just lowered and got the send! Now gotta do the OG. · Lead / Redpoint. Second go of the day. As sad as it makes me, the kneepad helped a lot. Incredible climb · Lead / Fell/Hung. Pretty tough, at least the top is chill. Beginning use toehooks to get mantle. Next part cross rh to crimp sidepull and get high feet. Then layback the bad slopers before getting knee bar, otherwise I can’t move off them · Everything up to the foot entry sequence was great, just kept falling after that. I think the right thing is getting the right foot higher when you scum it · Lead / Fell/Hung. Couldn't figure out the foot entry sequence on the flare. Just kept falling. · TR. Flare crux: layback using high L feet and R on face low knob and high chip. Then move L foot into rand smear to transition to other side. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard crux @ 3.5: possible w L crimp, LF dish, RF smear, R high sp for balance, move RF out, R fall into lower sp, LF out for L to arete. Then go up corner w R chickenwing and L gaston crimps, bumping up RF jam to aim for meh R crimp above · Lead / Redpoint. Nice one. Really only adds two short sequences, but the top of numba ten would probably make anything 4 stars. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Kinda stressful belay from dad. Fun! Hard. Need more burns to suss beta. And kneebar pads or pants. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Low crux felt harder than before somehow, maybe because it was in the sun · TR. TR in the shade after went much better. Stiff shoe / TC Pro might be the move. Big triangle hold - LF smear in scoop, RF up to jug and rock over / pistol. Cross LF behind then RF to top. LH on diagonal crimp LF kinda high and out to edge, LH arête, RH still squeezing sidepull to stand up, smear RF, LF to good black crystal, stay kinda low to swap feet, then LF really high into corner to find knee bar. Middle bit - LH on good corner hold and keep tension to reach up with RH to sidepull arête at obvious hold, then LH crimp/press to bring up LF to good edge Upper crux - RF good arête smear, RH good corner edge, LF good smear out a bit, LH crimp, RH to corner thumb on crimp, RF high to corner edge and rock over. RF on corner thumb crimp is key to getting RH up a couple moves later. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Maybe don’t try it in the sun. Didn’t go too well, although I finally figured out the transition so now I’ve done all the moves. · TR. Cruxes felt like getting into and out of knee bar (stem out?) and up high before small roof, where I used shouldery lockoff. 2 hangs on second go. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Good climbing! 3: slopey L arete, up LF to scoop, RF to hold, standup into faint ripple crimps, switch feet RF to point to reach clip Joining #10: R cross arete to L crimp in dihedral, R cross lean into seam pod, L bump sp up to sloper knob? R other seam pod to roof Corner above: up crimps to R palm knob, LF HIDDEN FOOT OUT LEFT! RF near R, L to crack Last 2: up crimps, L crimp near arete, R fall into faint diag crimp next to it. Insecure above around block - L crack left side, R right arete to slopey! ledge, L pocket crack · Lead / Redpoint. really good alternative for those that aren't in tune with the crux of Numbah 10 · TR. 2 hung it. Knee bar is feeling good and the first bludge feels better with the palm press. · TR. quick morning TR lap. cool temperature of 63, a very light rain, new resoled shoes, Mick Pearson's alpine harness that I borrowed, and not having climbed outside in 4 weeks. end result was the smoothest send I've ever had, where each crux just felt doable and easy without strenuous effort, just focus. wanted to immediately get on power horse but didn't have time. · TR. worked out some new beta for the bottom. Good movements off the first horn with some good feet. The knee bar beta turns out to be the best for the flare for me. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Blue totem / .4 if no stick clip to protect the start. Pulled through on the transition left - quite hot so sloper pinch didn’t work. Looking at photo, maybe transition even higher up · Lead / Redpoint. 3rd go, first index 5.12 in a day. For index, probably 12a (at least for taller folks IMO) · TR. quick lap in the morning. for the flare, press shoulder into the wall, move left hand into the crescent, right hand up above on thin crack, and just bring the right foot up to that little ledge. use shoulder to stabilize when bringing the foot up, don't try to scum and move up off the right foot until it's onto the ledge. then you can stand up. · TR. work through the bottom sequence up until the crossover still feels hard getting the left foot on the bad smear doesn't feel secure moving into the arete feels bad working on knee bar beta. made all the moves above that doesn't feel easy but it will go. · TR. aided through the bottom. felt very hard but it was after I projected japanese gardens · Lead / Fell/Hung. keep falling on the scumming right foot high enough. everything else is wired. I've sent it before, can't seem to remember the right moves · TR. fell getting into flare, shoes felt really slick all of a sudden. got top crux easily · Lead / Fell/Hung. cold, did on a sunny 35 degree day,but sun had just gone behind the mtns. got all moves, needed to take to warm up numb hands. did mix up last crux: remember to bring left hand up to get hidden side crimp. · Lead / Redpoint. 7 days of projecting during a summer heat wave. 6am conditions allowed the send. Fantastic line. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Managed every move except the crossover into the layback around the 6th bolt. I love this route · Lead / Redpoint. Sent it! scum right foot in flare, don't twist it. stand up. 2and crux: left hand up to right side crimp, skip left side crimps completely"

Another higher spot for blue or yellow totem, you could maybe wedge yourself in to place then step back down. Gun it until layback hands disappear, then right knee bar, reach left hand to 2 finger pocket, shimmy knee jam higher, then loooong reach with right hand to the jug! Horrifying lead prospect. Awesome TR · Lead / Flash. Holy crap this thing is good! Lowered over it and decided to give it a lead go. Soooo fun!! · Lead / Onsight. w RB. Managed to hold on for the OS - don't miss the secret jug! Place some gear and then fire to the top. · TR. Clean, lowered after topping out princely. Super rad, crux still the thin crack and moving up through the corner into the flare. Flare felt tamer than before, gun it to the end of the layback, double knee bar (place a piece??) then reach to deep 2 finger rail from knee bars, then home free! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard boulder problem then hard flare. Would be fun to project more · TR. TRS at end of day. 1st lap hung at thin crack cuz I wussed out but got layback clean. 2nd lap clean to layback but blew a foot starting it, 2nd tho clean. Otakis are great for this! BD red offset nut from R knee bar high on layback, no hands rest! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Didn't have enough small gear so bailed left to PA at ledge. · TR. 2x did as lieback..think you could place gear. did all the moves felt easier than slow children · TR. TRS. 3 laps, 2 & 3 clean, even with some gear faffeing for redirects! 2 falls on lap one at step right out of thin crack and slipped halfway through layback. Left knee jam only once where layback feature changes to get a piece, purple BD offset nut & 0.5 cam at start, sling a block near finish! Gun it, keep feet high! · TR. Fell twice at the the move right, foot sequence get left toe jam in flaring crack, right foot wide right to chicken head, left hand side pull, right hand grope up. layback start similar to velvet pedestal, final section can get knee bar to place pro. · Lead / Onsight. super fun blasted through the finger crack and lieback section, as little run out but that was my choice haha · Follow. anthony led. fell off on the Crux this time. man I love those arm knee bars on this one. · Lead / Onsight. never arm barred between my leg and the wall before...that was cool. · Lead / Onsight. Felt pretty easy. Super fun climb. Could have used another .2 or .1 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Improved from my one try leading this last year. Hung once. Fun. Felt way easier · Lead / Fell/Hung. Very hot out and I was really nervous. Hung several times. Lots of small gear on the initial crack. .3-.4. Also placed a 2 in the beginning. Lots of feet as you go up into the finger crack. Would have liked a metolius 0 and x4 red. Maybe alien black for t · Lead / Onsight. Super fun! Crux move is a high right hand that's hard to find. Look higher and use the right foot nub · Lead / Fell/Hung. Difficult, pumpy lieback. 1 opportunity for gear placement low inside corner. Small nuts/cams high up. · Follow. jay got this one, i did newest industry next (which has a hard move!) · Lead. Flailed because I didn't lieback. Lie it back when you need to place gear! · Climbed halfway without enough small gear. Down aided. Bring 3x .3 all the mini shit. ð"

        "route_tick_comments": "· Lead / Fell/Hung. super fun, starts kind of scary, have to get pretty high before first pro which was a .1 :P glad i brought lost of gear, its a long route and I used it up:-) took like a 15 foot whipper on the lay back, the lay back is just long and sustained, i tried to put my foot on the outside and lost my balance. you can also crack climb this apparently seems less strenuous but more awk. struggled in the top twin cracks as well, its just a very sustained long route as a whole but does have lots of good rest. the step around to the second ledge was pretty secure, next time i do it i'd consider skipping the pro on the first ledge, makes for a hard clean · Lead / Flash. Took the hand crack (right). Mantle after 3” section, then stepped to the left to do the final mantle. Protect the follower with an extra piece up high before stepping over, but it is possible to stay low and go left to avoid the potential pendulum · Lead / Redpoint. Got it clean, better gear placements and decision to move through crux · Lead / Redpoint. Led with Billy and Vadim following, went on to City Park and Slow Children · Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to grab a draw to clip at the flake. Going from layback to jamming. Good jams above a #3 · Lead / Fell/Hung. .4 20 ft up. Get good piece and lay back middle. Get deep arm up high, climb through. Got pumped from too much gear at layback, tried to jam. · Lead / Redpoint. Led this for the first time since my bail and finish a few months ago. Felt super chill and actually crack climbed it this time! · Lead / Fell/Hung. bb's first trad whip on a #3. Start gear: protect with nut, and .4 in horizontal pod (after initial moves - some juggy pockets out left below horizontal) when layback flake gets wide make sure to jam feet to get to top of flake · Lead / Fell/Hung. Accidentally did the 10a variation in the middle, that part went great! Foot slipped right at the end of the climb and took a whipper; aggghhhhh! · Lead / Fell/Hung. had absolutely horrendous head game on this. took a few times, pulled on gear, and took a practice fall which overall was good exposure to this style of climbing. however this mightve set me back mentally on trad. gotta take more practice falls on easier climbs. · Follow. Super hard. Off the ground even slick and hard. Very too on ledge for final moves was sketch. Jillian lead. · Lead / Onsight. 2 nuts right off the deck through blocky terrain...excellent crack after that. crux is for sure the mantle · Follow. Right after rapping with Chase Haigh and B showed up so we followed them back up Godzilla and went to Slow Children · Lead / Flash. I finally psyched myself up to lead this. It really wasn’t too bad. There’s a good .4 placement in a horizontal crack in the left side after standing up from the boulder start moves. I think I used some triples of finger sized pieces. I brought gear .1-3. I also used 2x#3 · Lead / Onsight. Extend draws before changing cracks 2x. Marginal pro first few moves · Lead / Redpoint. Felt quite good. This climb is 10a minimum. Don’t really need the #4. Optional. Didn’t place nuts. Don’t bring them. Double length sling is nice. Long pitch. · Lead / Fell/Hung. no gear for first 15 ft?!?! used another party's TR to place small cams and then continued up. Save a #2 and runner to protect crack before traverse. brought 3 5.s and would have used 4. · TR. Awesome climb. No good places to protect until 15-20ft off the ground. Can do the big flake section as a layback, with decent transitions to still place protection. However, its possible to somewhat stay in the crack, but we ended up partially face-climbing. · TR. Super fun climb but it was very hard for me! Really enjoyed it. · TR. Max lead. I TRd again. Need to get the courage up to lead next time · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took on the flake and had a second rest further up, pumpy but another great climb · Lead. First time leading it in two years, felt so much more casual that my first time climbing at Index · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung once, got pumped/scared on the flake! W/ Alex, bring doubles and took lots of small stuff. I used a 4, probably could have used some medium to large nuts to save cams. Extend rope to move leftward to reduce drag. · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Apparently, I hit the mountain project word count limit trying to be detailed about the beta, so I have saved personal notes under 2024 athletic section. Tripples upto .5 and doubles upto #3 with a set of stoppers and lots of slings (cant have enough because I needed to extend most placements, sometimes to prevent the deeper walk) for zero rope drag. · Lead / Pinkpoint. Climbed on Sandy's gear. A ~red ballnut would be nice to not have a ground fall after the direct start's black totem. · Lead / Flash. First 5.9 trad Index flash. Beta: Small nut near the first hold to protect the first couple of moves. Then there is a big run out unless you can find a .3 in a small pod to the right before a layback move, or a .4 in a horizontal crack to the left. Gotta look hard for this. Then chill climbing up to a big horn that you can sling with double length sling, seems pretty bomber. Then a bit more climbing, I think I placed a green or purple. Then you have to decide whether to go left or right around the flake. I placed a #1 at the bottom of the right side, extended, and then stepped over to the left. Supposedly the right is more fun with good jamming technique. Be sure to save a 0.4 for the final moves. You gotta do a couple of ring locks and place left foot on a marginal foothold, and then reach up to a good jug, rail, and then work over left. · Lead / Redpoint. Good breaks when you need them. Would like to continue to repeat and try more jamming, better technique. Feels good to finally send! · TR. Followed Ryan’s lead. Such a good pitch. For sure 10a. And that fucking start is always unnerving. A #4 could be used to protect down low, or other .4-.75 pieces. · Lead / Flash. With Tbird and Rich! Rainy and ominous. Surprisingly comfortable with unprotected start. Felt very secure."

After slab: swap right hand to undercling, work feet up, left hand to mono, right to side pull below it, right foot into crack and throw right to rail.

TR. 2 goes. Felt really hard first time on first crux, got through second crux pretty easily. Second go, first crux went smooth and second crux felt hard, pinky started bleeding. Great route. · 3 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Ayyyy got it second go of the day, then a TR lap for fitness. Love this rig (with Melissa) · 2 pitches. TR. Two pitches all moves free, coming back for that lead! Easier than Japanese gardens imo · Lead / Fell/Hung. First lead go! In the dark. Blew it at the mantle into the upper dihedral! A bummer, but so stoked. Single .2 to .75. But I may have place 3 .3s. Bring nuts next time · Follow. followed nick and 1 hung at low crux 2x— think i could have gotten it second go, but had to clean a nut that nick whipped on which was quite stuck! super fun but would be a scary lead on tiny cams and nuts, get on another tr when you can · TR. Did the roof today! Sagittarius roof, lie back with both hands then bring right hand up, really good. · TR. Tape left pinky. Gear beta in order: blue tcu, .1, red&orange ball nuts, blue/yellow offset, .5, .75, .4, blk totem, red/yellow offset after roof, 0 · TR. 2nd roof: dynamic move up with the right to the better crimp felt good. · TR. slab move is fun, the next crack and getting into the chimney was quite hard. · TR. First crux. Left foot out of left flake. Left hand in deep pocket under pitons. Move right hand to right crack pocket. Move right foot to knob. Left foot in pocket. Left hand to bottom pocket. Left foot on slab rock up on it. Right hand above left. · No asterisk send, finishing on sag. TRed flare - L chicken wing + inchworm facing right feels secure enough, but might be a bit runout on small gear in second half… · Lead / Fell/Hung. Whipped on pins to get nerves out and fell pulling into flare · Lead / Fell/Hung. Felt good all the way but fell again getting into flair. Just pumped and Crimpd didn’t feel as good, just needed to try but kinda gave up there · Lead / Redpoint. .4,.3,.1/.2 offset, .2 (or nut), tat, black totem, .5 w/ draw, .4,.75, black totem · TR. Clean to 1st anchors and up to top of sag 2nd anchors and through roof to 3rd anchors on ledge. Fell once going through final roof before ledge · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 hang, first time trying to lead it. Fell rocking onto the slab of all places. Updated gear beta - .4, .3, 3 purple peenut, gold 7 offset, .4 on left & .2, 5 silver peenut, 0, blue totem w/ black sling, 1, smaller blue 8 offset, .3, black totem on right · Lead / Redpoint. The iron horse blew its horn and rolled on by as I pulled on. Had a few bits out of sequence but it didn’t matter, I was in flow and improvised perfectly. Magical. To Croft chains. Powerhorse / Full Horse Power next year? · 2 pitches. TR. Bottom fine, much easier with stiff shoes. Need more endurance for those final boulder moves though · 3 pitches. TR. tr solo. at pins get high r feet, l in crack, r on chip, l to big foot. mono l, r crimp at roof lip, l to good edge. need to tick feet. at higher crux work on feet and use r foot step through when on good crimps to wiggle into flare. tape middle 2 on both hands, wear tcs · 4 pitches. TR. Almost sent on TR with placing gear but forgot to unclip directional and fell. For slab crux went RH in lower pod, maybe try switched based off previous comment, once stood up and placing blue totem, use RH undercling to move LH to higher mono, RF smear higher, LF on corner edge, RH up to crimp and then cross to jug. For upper crux, LF leaves ledge, RH in pod, LH finger lock, RF up to bottom of top pod, RH finger lock, stand and LH tips lock for balance and bump up, fully stand to bring RH to ring lock, LH to block with crack and place .3 · Lead / Redpoint. Re sent. Additional black totem (could be blue c3) at crux · TR. Hung before first crux, then pulled it and climbed into the second crux. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Two lead attempts. Actually made it through all the cruxes on the second one but fell after getting tunnel vision in the dihedral. Almost got 3(?!) Nuts stuck on the first attempt, but Heather got them all out by bringing up a rock. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Absolutely punted. Fell on every crux. Quite an un-send. Gear beta: .4. .3, #5 dmm brassie placed from no hands ledge, black totem. bomber silver flat dmm nut a foot or two below pins (slots way down). Pins. Gold dmm offset up right by slab (no need to extend). .5 in horizontal with draw. .4 and optional blue dmm offset. .75 in crack just before roof (perhaps gets in the way?). Another black can be placed above good lock (unused) before pulling crux move or afterwards to make clipping the chains less scary · Lead / Redpoint. Very good line! Approximate rack: 0 metolius/.2 Z4 .2 Z4 2-3 medium DMM Offsets (small BD nuts will also work in a pinch) quickdraw .3 Z4 or #7 DMM offset (optional) .5 C4/orange metolius .4 C4 .3 C4 .75 C4 · Lead / Redpoint. gahhh second go. blew the onsite by not placing gear over the roof, getting scared and dropping off. feels pretty chill with the beta. only to lowest anchor. · TR. Not even close to climbing this thing, locking with pinky and ring fingers and just enough friction to make some moves slightly possible, not sure how this is a 5.11 · TR. fell on finger crack, did the whole flared corner clean on tr tho!! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Tired at the end of the day, but onsighting wasn't happening anyway. At pins step left into undercling. Gold offset nut out right. Get right hand undercling, left hand up to marginal pin scar, right hand crimp, feet up onto nothing, right hand to jug. Rest standing on ledge. Place 2 pieces and go to \"jug\", the place 0.75. Left had to bad pin scar, right hand crimp on the left crimp, feet up and left hand up. Run it out to the chains. · Lead / Redpoint. To the first chains! Wahoo Master belay from Jessica (and master supervision provided by maple) After a 3/4 hang go One day I’ll do the flare lol · TR. Hung rope off sag, fired to the compression locks above the pin. Cranked bad bets into the eventual restful mono undercling. Had to take a few times figuring out the boulder, but unlocked nicely. The next section of crack is chill, but one more punch into the mini stem box. · TR. great warm down. started putting right foot on nub juust up and right of piton, weighting it, then moving right hand up. pretty easy. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Tiny bit slimy out. Rough go I knew it would be hard but wow I felt humbled. Kinda had to aid through both cruxes at various points out of fear more than anything. With Jess and Andrew and Gloria and of course maple! · Lead / Fell/Hung. fell several times trying to dial in gear. hurt my finger working on final crux. · TR. great warm up on TR. perfect way to warm up for power horse · Lead / Redpoint. With Micah and Teddy. To Ringing Flake. 6 TR laps, 7th lead go. Finally sent!!!! · TR. With Micah and Teddy. TR'ed the upper chimney. Would be spicy to lead! · TR. First go on the bottom section. I was too chickenshit to lead the top of Sagittarius because it was dripping. I should have just aided it duh. But wow cool moves and hard but doable?? · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. With Derrick. First go: 2 hangs, one at second crux and one at third crux. Second go: 2 falls, one at second crux and one at third crux. · Lead / Redpoint. Green brass and gold alloy offset nut Black Blue .2/.3 offset .75 #1 · Lead / Fell/Hung. With Brandon. Took some small whips and did all the moves on lead which is a good start. · TR. Blue totem above pins before slab crux. Above pins - left hand bottom and right top then hard foot up and rock over to left middle finger mono. Stand up with RF out, then RH mono/crimp, RF in, LF out, bump RH to furthest crimp, LF to edge at lip, LH mono/crimp, RH to jug. Top crux trust the feet and RH ring lock at base of chimney is key · TR. got all moves. second roof: left hand in crack, right next to it on sloper. hop left hand up, right hand out right to crimp. left foot up to roof pod, climb crimps. · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Tried it with Reed. Whipped on 6 brassy and then again on black totem on top. Then clean TR send. · TR. Wow, super cool. Right hand under cling left hand up to small edge, sort feet out and go right to the good edge. Upper crux, match on rail, right foot high in pod, right yand up to edge, left hand to pod. Move feet up and right hand to edge out right. Press into corner and go into crack. · TR. right hand on undercling to get past first roof. second roof, match on ledge and push off right foot in highest flare. · TR. Hung before piton and then many times at top crimp moves. Kind of feels doable but don’t have the strength endurance for those top moves yet · TR. Still f-in hard but felt more do-able than last time. But still fucked. · TR. Several takes. Very thin, pin scars mostly. Crux felt like the squeeze at the top. Super fun! Will plan to work it more. · Lead / Fell/Hung. First lead attempt, 1 hang at pins not sure of gear after. Crucial red offset nut in mini dihedral. Offbalancey feet w mono undercling. Don’t plug corner after second crack; nut pod above · Lead / Redpoint. Only the short variation, but still very happy. The tat on the pins can be backed up by clipping a trad draw to the lower pin and then the rope biner through the master point. second arching crux protects with a gold dmm offset nut, but I didn't find it. .5 in the horizontal to the right before standing up on the ledge. From the ledge you can get lots of gear in the wide bit. Last crux before 1st anchor protects well with a .75 in the edge of the roof and a blue (black?) totem in one of the pin scars above it. · Lead / Redpoint. first go of the day! 3rd lead go 4 or 5 top ropes over a couple years but first lead attempt where I actually knew the beta. stoked. hardest index send now for stern farmer · dogged on lead again, clean on tr. above the piton get the left undercling, right foot on a little divot on the left, left foot on basically nothing, right hand up into sidepull mono, bring right foot into the thin crack and left foot on the Bulge. right hand uses the worse under cling to stabize and get left hand cross to side pull then stand up and keep going along the rail, left foot on knob then it's jug city. 2nd crux both hands on juggy block twist left foot in the crack and try to get to the right crimp then left foot in pod and left hand to the even higher crimp. gear .3, small nut, .1, black totem/ .2, tat, black totem, .5 or .75 in rail, yellow totem, .75 , black totem, blue totem. · Lead / Fell/Hung. All nuts. Fell once at slab (invert) and twice at upper crux, OS flare, big whip at roof. Lowered from Sag anchors, I'll be back."

Next time dial in gear that works best for me... bring: doubles .4-4, triples .2-.3, some smaller nuts, .1/.2 cam and figure out my best gear · Lead / Redpoint. First try of the day, lugging the full doubles to 4 · 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. woohoo! Finally found it open and didn’t fall at the crux, skipping middle bad jam: L second (good) lock, R high to ok (second highest) pod, feet up, L highest good · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Still need to figure out rests and 2nd crux move more reliably · 2 pitches. TR. Would be a safe but exciting lead. Bump #4 thru layback, mostly thin gear for the top but save #1 or #2 for the hand crack section above finger lock crux. Easier to layback the finger locks and use the corner for feet than use foot nubbin out right. Exciting big moves to a bomber hand jam. After traverse out right some wild moves getting the feet up to get to the jug from the slopey rail out right. Need to keep working lf up the corner to reach jug, can also do some pressing/mantling on the slopey rail. · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Almost! Roof: R sp crack, L fit into second fingerlock (better pulling down than sidepull). Jam high LF toe, make sure L down to reach R to bad, bump to better Top: jug jam #2, stem RF to good knob, place good blue totem (last piece). L good sp, RF smaller nub, R crimp, LF inside out on righter crack to boost L to gaston, HIGH RF to better toejam, LF off lefter crack, L to sp. Up RF, eventually to crimp. Runout offbalance if RF too right (can place .3 base sp, or better .4 above) · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Destroyed again. Need to do it fresh, 5 whips at 2nd crux · 1 pitch. TR. Tr on first full pitch to the second chains. First crux beta: left hand in the upper pin scar, walk left foot up to the bump near the arete above the roof, right foot far right, somehow move right into the bomber lock high, past all the pin scars, then fists to hands up. Second crux, no good beta yet, will work next season. · Two laps each of P1 & 3, with TFM instead of P2. Fell one million times on p1 at the tight finger corner first time, sailed through it second go · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Only 2 takes this time and 1 fall! Finally figured out the 2nd crux beta · 2 pitches. TR. 2 laps. Feeling more solid after working some beta. Big flapper on lower crux second go. R hand to painful pod below the fist jam, then L hand pinky down into finger pod instead fist jam. Can milk rest after lieback in right crack · Lead / Fell/Hung. I led 1 and 4, Dan 2 and 3. Nothing bigger than a 2 needed past the first pitch, and definitely don’t need doubles from .5-2 · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Got destroyed. Took 2 hours to lead it. Probably whipped 10+ times and took another 40. Second crux was a challenge · 5 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. With Rio. Finally checked out all 4 pitches. Led P2. TR'ed P2 again on the way down. Feels like P2>4>1>3 in terms of difficulties. · 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. Finally, totally improvised at first Crux but fought through. · 1 pitch. TR. Fell multiple times, amazing route. Do it later when I’m stronger · 1 pitch. TR. Really struggled in 2nd crux. Want to go back and try leading now · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. .5, .4 ext, red nut, 3 ext, 3 ext, .2 ext, bolt, 4, .5, .3, 2, .3, 4 HB, .5 · Lead / Fell/Hung. w/ lucas. flailed and aided my way up all four pitches. begged the question of whether i've ever actually climbed a 5.11 before this. psyched to come back. · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Great conditions; fraught footwork. Bury me with a blue totem when I go. · Lead / Redpoint. Full first pitch. RP fourth try of the night with Shane · 1 pitch. TR. First crux went easily: L hand in higher good lock, R hand reach to marginal, L foot in shallow toe jam under roof, reach through · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. tried the straight-in method for the #4 wide section today, felt more tiring than the lieback method... work on finding the rests. First crux felt easier today with high smearing feet... just don’t use the crack for feet on first crux · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Cruised pretty good up to the roof crux. Messed up beta en whipped just before good lock. Roof beta is to get high thumbs down right and pinky down left, bump up right to next lock and left to the old right lock. Move left foot up to highest jam, keep torso facing crack. Bump right to good jam and left to hand jam. Aided up a bit of the stemming, psyche lost. Oh well next time · 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Led P3 clean. Did a TR lap as well. · TR. Trs p2 1x & p3 2x. Did climb to right of p3 as well. Hot · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. I was SLIPPING out of this thing cause I was so sweaty. Jeeeeeeez. Miss those Index summa condis · TR. Climbed with a couple of German visitors Paul and Sophie. Need to work that first crux out again that still feels desperate. Second crux feels significantly easier for me and repeatable · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Tough burn with the bois quince and salmon. Really amazinf · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on P1. Led p2-3 clean. TR ed p1 clean on the way down. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led p1 and p2 clean on 7/24 and Stamati took it to the top. · Lead. Did JG full with Matt Michie, lead p2&4 Multi fell on p2 but sent everything else. My gold DMM offset that I bootied off JGp1 a week or so ago is now fused in p2. Just gotta comeback for p2 now · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. 5.11b my ass. The 4s section is super challenging, fingers section is chill. · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to pull through finger lock crux, skin was shredded. · 1 pitch. Lead / Flash. Easier than Freeway and Butterballs. Similar difficulty to Shirly · Lead / Fell/Hung. Full with Simon fell once on two make sure to get left in the last good finger jam. And fell twice on last pitch bring two yellow totems two black totems and two blue totems. · 10 pitches. TR. Pitched 1-3 TRS plus another 10 pitches of other stuff on the upper part of the wall. Long hot day. · TR. Jack put it up, got all the moves with a couple hangs at the crux. Layback the wide, forget about the butterfly · 2 pitches. Lead. This is the greatest and best climb in the world :) and sushi farmer wooooow :) .5ext, graylienext, reddmmext, 2or3, 3or4, golddmm, draw, 4ext, .4or.5, .3, 2, .3 · 1 pitch. Lead. First crux more wet. Second crux felt easier. Felt good to finally get the full lead. · 2 pitches. TR. Two burns, one hang, both cruxes were wet, fired cruxes several times. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to aid second and forth pitch. But both should go at some point. · 1 pitch. TR. Followed paddy who crushed it and sent today. Nice job paddy · 1 pitch. TR. Burn of pitch 1 Japanese Gardens, got better finger beta for first crux. Would like to come back and figure out my feet. Thinking a different shoe on my right foot. · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Frick, bring triples in black and blue totems if linking first two pitches · 1 pitch. TR. Just the first pitch and holy hell i mean it was in the sun but wow was that hard · Lead / Fell/Hung. .4, .3, 2, 4, .2, anchor, 4, 1, gold nut, 2, .3, .1/.2, .5 · Follow. Followed up Kevin the whole thing, so damn hard. He did great, I’m psyched. · Lead / Fell/Hung. The full four this time! Lead 2 & 4, all clean except for the cruxy (and wet) move left on p4, which took a few tries to do a spanny move bypassing the wet slopers. Nice for P1 to feel smooth (even if just following). w Bill · 1 pitch. TR. I'd love to work on this as a project to lead. Pitch 1! · 2 pitches. TR. TRd P1 got the short version of P1 clean then fell a lot haha · 1 pitch. 1 pitch. Did 3rd pitch 1x TRS. Exited right at top roof. · 1 pitch. TR. First pitch. Would need gear to 4 and extra in fingers for finger lock section at top. Cool route. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Feel at finger crack but found new way. Get left fingers in good pod and right hand higher. Lay back and get a foot smear just under the .3 cam. Right foot still goes to foot chip. The layback should allow an easy move to the sinker fingers. Turn to face the wall as fingers sink in to help torque them. Ethan says a nut goes above the last .3 cam · Lead / Fell/Hung. Felt hard. Finger crux. Left hand high in second pod. Lean into wall. Right hand above. Left foot smear on edge of slab. Right foot kick up far right edge. Bump left foot higher. · 1 pitch. TR. Tried pulling out he first crux several times but eventually gave it up. · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Save blue, black totem, .1/.2 for top. .5,.4, .3 or big grey nut, 2, 3 (or4), .3, anchor, 4, 2?, .5, black totem, 2, .3,.2, .1/.2, .75 · 1 pitch. TR. Once again first crux feels worse - can't do move in iso. · 3 pitches. Follow. Lap 1 to mid anchor Lap 2 to chains, 5 falls Lap 3 to chains, 2 falls · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. First crux now a problem, couldn't pull. Second crux goes easily with layback/foot match beta. · 1 pitch. TR. clean. for top crux use layback foot plus hand foot match beta · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. With Vivian and Long. Unsent :( Turns out warming up on JG might not be the brightest idea lol · 1 pitch. TR. crux 1: left hand in last good finger lock thumbs up, long lock off right hand all the way up to good lock where it widens (bump if needed). then work feet up. crux 2: kick right to knob, stem left foot. left hand on highest juggy side pull, work feet up, right hand sloper (right side of ledge). then left foot jam, left hand as high as possible to finger lock. left foot on nub, right foot on slabby foot right of crack, reach up right hand to good finger lock, then done · 3 pitches. TR. tape r index, l pinky. first crux goes with right lock above good lock, bring l into good lock, bump right. l foot toejam. upper crux use r foot knob smear, l lock to bump foot. 2 good whips · 1 pitch. Lead. Crux: L fingerlock in second pod, R to marginal one, smear RF, then bump to good. Pull-up feet after Top: gear in left crack: yellow offset nut, .2 cam in good pod, stem to right crack, gaston cam pod to bring up LF, R goodish hold (opt .2/.3 behind? Or small nut in non-pod part of left crack - last gear before runout!) R Gaston above, work feet up left then right, L to pod, aim R for crimp. L to corner, RF match R. · 1 pitch. Lead. crack was wet, so I aided through the Boulder problem section. didn't have a number four, so just ran out the section after the chains for about 15 ft. heady but straightforward . · Lead / Redpoint. Finally got this classic! First attempt of the year. Switched beta to use the crimp and it felt smooth. Dunno why I didn’t revisit that last year. · 1 pitch. TR. at low crux, keep l hand thumbs down in layback below roof and reach up to R locks. bump L to pinky down lock, bump R to good lock. L foot below roof and huck · 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. Finally! I think this was my sixth try total. Got the send train with Ahad and Sergey who did it in a day. · Lead. Two 4s would feel comfy for the layback, but doable with 1. 3x .3 · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. went to the second anchor, fell because i was scared. · 1 pitch. Did 3rd pitch 1x TRS. Exited right at top roof. Cool variation. · 2 pitches. TR. Trs p2 & p3. Great pitches. Did another 1/2 pitch of something up and slightly right of anchors (below tommy sandbox rood) · Lead / Fell/Hung. Grp of 3 with Reid and Mike. Led p1 which may have been one of my favourite gear pitches anywhere. P4 slab BP was wicked fun. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 0.5,.4,.4 add alpine sling for first part. #3, .3 Extend second sling on chains 4 alpine slings First crux has a low right foot on the lip of the overhang. Left foot small knob commit and reach right for sinker fingers. Second crux, add sling to #2 then I move right, place .3, then stem back over. Use right hand to bump right foot higher. Push up on right foot and pull left fingers. Then lean back right and palm it. High right foot · TR. New top crux beta: Go out right. Get left toe in right crack then get right foot above it · 1 pitch. TR. Wide part takes two 4s, transition to pulling into and over the face to really big crack, stem up to anchor. · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Got down to 1 hang. Didn’t have the gas for the last move. Kind of just let go. Really nice night though. · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. fell at first crux, tried laybacking. fell again/took at next crux · 1 pitch. TR. Gear to 1st Anchor: 1, 0.4 + sling, 0.2 + sling, 2, 4 + sling, 0.1 Gear to Finish: 4 + sling, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1 optional at crux, 2/3 at rest, 0.2 + sling right crack, 0.1/0.2 offset above, 0.5, 0.2/0.1 to left to keep rope out of crack., anchor, 2nd #4, · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Same as last time basically but fewer falls. This was the early am session where Jess left a knot in the rope!!! Oops lol so had to go back up for it leading on the other end. Meant I got another lead in. But boy it got sunny fast. Evening is better :) · 1 pitch. TR. Pulled on one cam mid fingers crux due to collateral ligament. Otherwise felt very chill :) love that upper boulder problem. And surfed stern stem crux on the way down :> · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Couple hangs at both cruxes. Really cool lived up to the hype · TR. Crux was harrd. Lots of figuring it out. I think using high left hold, right crimp doing a big power layback into the jam is the move. Definitely gotta do some laps on it and get it down · 1 pitch. TR. Tr first pitch! Forced me to crack climb lol fun and engaging · Lead / Fell/Hung. Full 1st pitch, these fat sausage fingers struggled on the thin finger locks at the crux’s · 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. Finally sent it! First go of day, just barely held it together, thanks Viv! · 2 pitches. TR. 5.9/10a start pitch felt hardest beta-wise. Still find wide stuff hard. Mostly lie-backed it. The thin fingery part of JG was straightforward but ofc still strenuous. Felt easier than Even Steven though (perhaps more sustained with easier individual moves?). · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. down to 2 falls on lead for full P1, then did a TR lap to work the cruxes some · 1 pitch. Lead. good warm up for powerhorse, sent it. top ropes to first chains, then led the rest. that put me in a great headspace, the route felt pretty easy to execute. · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. first go on lead, bitched out after placing the 4 on the lay back. went down and did it again on tr. · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. probably 5 or 6 total falls/takes, iwith a proper ride on the last part. thanks karissa for the catches! will continue to work maybe with shade and actual warmups · 1 pitch. TR. Full first pitch. Hung once at lower crux and twice at upper crux · 1 pitch. TR. 2 falls on a TR go (next time go for finger not fist; and reach higher into crack from the right edge). need to lead it next time · 1 pitch. Lead. felt tired , 2nd route of the day, sent it though. · 1 pitch. TR. warmed up on the bottom, then went ground up on the second one all the way to the finger lock crocs. from there I passed that and worked out the top sequence. top sequence starts off with right foot on large nub right hand inside pull left hand inside pull, next smear left foot up 4 in on front face, then step right foot up on small nub, place left foot in the Right face lobe and then reach right hand up to crimp rail left hand goes out to the left finger locks high then right foot comes up very high into the top node from there Cam the right foot in and reach right hand up to the bottom of the flare left foot goes out to smear against the side rail. lay back the top by working the feet up The left side get the right hand down on the crimp rail and then work your right foot up to the crimp, from there stand up on the crimp while laying back the flare I got a handjam and the top of the flare which helps a lot. stand up reach right hand high to the finger lock and that's the end of the route. · 1 pitch. Lead. great. did it clean, top felt easy. right ft in crack, left foot, then right hand on rail, move right foot high up in crack, then left foot out, then left hand lieback into flare, bring right foot up onto right ledge rail . · 1 pitch. TR. first pitch is dialed. gear for the first could be 2 4s? a .4 for the second placement works great. figured out going to the chains a heal toe cam works better than standing on the rail with the left. the second pitch crux one ) move through the wide crack laying it back fast. crux2) after milking the rest, the finger sequence is left, right then work feet up on the left face stand on nub then bump hands up a little the get right hand hight and kick the index finger with a thumb pitching the bottom. smear the right foot way right then left foot on the sloper and get the left hand into the bottom of the crack then pull hard and slam a good jam up hight with the right. current idea for the top r , l foot in bottom then move left hand out left then move right foot in and lock then stand up and reach the jug? new high point. was the top crux · 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. With Lukasz. P1 full. Finally sent!!! 7 TR laps, 10th lead go. Came full circle since my first time on JG was with Lukasz. · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. With Brandon. First go: 1 fall - peeled off the very last move before the good hand jam on the second crux lmao. Second go: too worked for a proper redpoint attempt. · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. With Niki. 2 falls one at each crux on first go. 1 fall on the second crux on second go."

Lead / Redpoint. 1 very cold TR lap and then sent first lead try. Could be nice to have 2 #3's for the wide section, ran it out a little but would have been a clean fall. · Lead / Onsight. Was going for the whole p1 but fell out of OW and whipped immediately onto #4 after the first chains lol. Then was getting late and Andrew wanted to go. Must come back for full send next time. 4 pieces to anchor. · TR. Kurt H on belay! free climbed first 1/3 til the thin seam and crack splits. Aided the rest of the way up. Climbers Fest clinic - improvised aid & french free with Adam B · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got stumped in the wide section up top, overall super fun also. · Lead. One hang. Fell going into #3 crack with first. Needed to layback with left foot on edge then in crack. · Lead / Redpoint. not sure if I onsighted but I did this a few times while trying full P1 of JG. approximate date · Lead / Onsight. A little spicy off the 2nd piece of gear. Did with Jakob. Clipping the chains is a tricky cunt too · Follow. Erron led, felt hard, fell twice. Again with the pumpy bro feel. Lots of hard laybacks and pulling up hard/mantling in lower town walls. #4 section was hard, wear long sleeves next time. Last move to the chains was also tenuous. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fun climb. A nice wide hands crack. Felt pumped from the get go from previous days climbing. #4 towards top · Lead / Fell/Hung. Did much worse this time. Multiple takes, way more pumped from the previous two climbs · TR. Max lead and flashed. Haley trd and had a take in the middle of the crux section. That section would be a scary lead for me. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung once right below the wide section. Need to find a better stance while plugging the 1. Great 3 to bumping 4 on loose fists. Eventually use the outside of the flake outside the crack, I lay backed a piece of this while bumping 4. Burly, But excellent. · Lead / Redpoint. 2nd try, bailed 1st try. wide at the top and strenuous! 3rd 10 ever and a proud lead for me :) · Lead / Fell/Hung. Almost had it clean, had to take once right before the ledge · Lead / Fell/Hung. Climbed with Rachel as first climb back was pumpy amd didn’t bring a 4 · Lead / Fell/Hung. David gave me lots of awesome gear beta... David and Joe coached and encouraged me thru the crux of pulling that linebacker onto a right foot. Sadly, after pulling that move my right calf was Elvis legging like crazy and shortly after I got the #.4 in, I grabbed the webbing before clipping the rope. I continued up snd got super scared on the handle traversal and took so long on it haha. David and Joe encouraged me to stick with it again and I'm so glad I did. However, once I got to the handjam it wasn't quite as restful as I'd hoped, so I hung. Gear: #.5, #.3, (possible #.1 before crux move?), #.4, #2, #3, #4, #.3, and finally can add a black totem for extra security for the last move. The last move is not bad at all to that jug :) Just inch up on left hip/ back as far as possible till layback + left foot/leg in wide crack then throw to great right foot and grab the jug. Send it next time... · TR. TRd it after leading it to dial in the feeling of all the moves, especially the traversal crux at the bottom and getting up into the #2/#3 crack. It feels really solid, especially the top part to clip the chains, so I'm hoping I get it clean next time. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Bailed before the wide section because was too scared. Dialed in the sequence on TR after Anthony got the rope up. · Lead / Onsight. Great climb. Fairly pumpy (I liebacked the 4s section). Also tired from the day before. .2 in the thin seam, then .4. Once on the flake rail I plugged a #1 then in the hand crack #2, #3, #4. And at the last move a .3 and .1 in right flake. Maybe next season I’ll try the first full pitch. After I climbed, this guy attempted to lead rope solo the thing. Was super inexperienced and sketch and took a fall from the jug horn after the thin section. Ripped a .2 (from a spot where I placed a .4) fell ~30 ft. And stopped 1ft from the ledge. No helmet. Would have been gravely injured if the crux .2 cam blew or if he had any more slack in the system. Scary. We offered to belay a regular lead, he pumped out and took a huge whip, then came down and Bjorn climbed the thing again to get the gear. Yowza · Climbed it with Cam, only the first 5.9 section and it kicked our ass. Clearly I need to get in better shape cause I bailed like a whiny little baby on the upper hand crack Bring a #4 and nuts · Follow. Excellent but found the off width at the chains to be the crux · Alright so Joey and I split this lead. I did the first part and there is this sketchy face traverse section that scared me and then you have to pull over this little ledge where the crack widens A LOT. Joey led that section, and I liebacked the whole thing when I followed · Lead. Jam slipped and i took a 20 footer about 2 moves from topping out the flake and hurt my ankle pretty badly. Managed to finish the climb, gotta get it clean next time! Used a .1-.3, 2, 3, 1 alpine. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took my way up to the base of the wide crack and called it a day. Mentally very spooky! · Lead / Fell/Hung. With grant — whipper into the first slab pocket and unable to reach the anchors · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took when it widened to #4. found the top out slippery and scary. · TR. Followed Aivy. Beware of rope drag and we found the top to feel very wide. She wished she had 2 4s. · Lead. Definitely was not pretty. Rope drag was bad. Bring two #4's for upper. Had to actually aid to get to chains. Maybe #6 would fit??? Wished I had bigger hands and wasn't short overall. · Lead / Onsight. First pitch in Index. Crux was clipping the chains, strange anchor. · Lead / Fell/Hung. took a nasty whipper trying to clip the chains : ( · 4 pitches. TR. Led it almost to the top and then just kept taking big whippers - witnessed the fitness. Ran laps on TR w/Chris. · Lead / Flash. Hard, but got it clean. Wide corner crack, and tricky move to the anchor but protected with a nut, brought 0.3-4 with some doubles · Follow. Fun! Learned some great crack technique. Feeling strong and more confident on granite. With Josh · Lead / Redpoint. 0.75z4, orange totem, 0.2/0.3 Offset and yellow alien out left, 0.1/0.2 Offset (decent), blk tot (mehh) in crux, 0.3 &0.4 z4, blue totem (careful, get eyes on it) start of rail, 0.3/0.4 Offset end of rail, WC #1,2,3 then bump 4 up fist. 0.2 & blue tot at end, leave the big cams behind! · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. face the wall at the top chimney, tool twice om the fist crack, use the chock stones in the crack. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took too long in finger rail before hand crack, got spooked by flaring crack and placing blind gear, hung on a cam. Blk tot at bottom then blue totem at top, then step up and layback into the hand crack & rest. 0.75 & orange totem low, blk & blue totem left before slab step right, 0.1/0.2 & 0.2/0.3 cams high reach before slab, then 0.3 & 0.4 after. hand crack 1,2,3,4 then #6 & 0.2-0.3 great for top out. could skip the 6 (which was really good, better than the 5, but in the way a lot trying to left side chimney) and place 2 small pieces at top. · Lead / Fell/Hung.

I was getting a bit freaked out swinging in space on TR! · Follow. Lack of bouldering and sport climbing this season showing. Did a lot of pull ups and pulling on gear. Great route though! · TR. Should’ve led this. Great gear between insecure cruxes. Just gotta reach further than you think. · TR. Felt pretty doable after a few hangs to figure out the right beta. · TR. 1 hung at thin .2/.3 crux, will grab the inobvious side cling jug next time and go left hand high. Some spooky holds and blocks in this one, chalked up flake edge low down flexes, fridge size block at top is detached/hollow sounding. · TR. Fun tr from boc. All moves felt solid, just need to sus the gear for a full send! Flake is...Definitely sus. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Whipped twice but could get it in the future. Should climb from lower anchors for a more full pitch, although… the pump. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got absolutely trashed. 3, .4 (not in finger), .2, .5, .75., red totem, .5 is probably all the gear you need. .2, double .3 to 1, 3. · TR. Very good. Lead next time 1 three for the start and lots of .3 · TR. did two TR solo pitches seems reasonable it's all there just some hard pulling and long reaches on good finger locks. there is a jug side pull that makes the thinnest section much easier don't miss it · TR. Fell once at bottom when I missed an undercling and again mid way when I didn’t grab the jug deep enough. Probably need a little more fitness to lead something this steep. · Lead / Onsight. So sick. Did at same time Hunter was dong BOC and had a little friendly speed competition. Def got a lil spooked trying hard w the exposure, but just focused on beating hunter (didn’t) didn’t think abt it. Climber super fast w no rest. Quite sporty. · TR. solid finger locks, combo of layback and smearing. Altogether really fun, strenuous but not particularly hard · TR. Really hard!!! Lots of different sizes of jamming and some reachy moves to jugs! Burly but fun · TR. Got it clean on toprope. Too hot to try leading it though.

Fell sorting things out but eventually got all the boulders from stances. Will be back · TR. Aided to the chains. Climbers fest clinic with Adam B - improvised aid & french free techniques. · TR. To first chains. Lh side pull, rh thumb press, foot on steep crimp · Lead / Redpoint. To first anchor W Andrew. Stoked on the RP especially off the Couch! Good shoes are really nice on this one. Instincts came in really handy. Much better than the old moccasins I had last time. · Lead / Fell/Hung. a few falls at bolt 3, small feet! upper crux wasn't too hard, committing moves to good holds · TR. So hard at the crux. Too spanned put and couldn’t do it. The rest of the climb is fun though. Glad i wasn’t leading! · Lead / Redpoint. Full on first lead go! Gear for upper: 1, 2, .5, 2x .2, 2 draws, .3 · TR. Upper crux: 2 black totes, r foot on knob just under roof, r hand high Gaston, l foot onto bottom of left facing big edge above r foot on face (tick crystal before moving), trust l foot, l hand to clipping hold. Blue totem between last bolt and chains. Green c3 or shitty black totem also possible · Warmed up on this bad boy on a hot day. I am definitely warm so…success. My cousin’s first outside climb. Good job. · TR. TR the full for the first time. Second half is fantastic and felt considerably easier. After ledge, high L foot and stretch to far L sidepull to rock over, back stepping to small foot with R. Undercling felt desperate. Put R foot on chip and keep it there · Lead / Redpoint. Full (well to the 35m anchor) pitch this time! Finally got the bottom clean and the second have went clean first go! Cool temps and overcast helped a lot · Lead / Fell/Hung. A couple silly falls trying to cross feet instead of match. Undercling w high feet is dope. High step not bad. Extend the first cam. Not an ideal climb for shorties. Bring .1, .1/.2, 3x .2, 2x .3, .4, 2x.75, 1, 2, 8 draws, two alpines, anchor. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Pulled on 2nd and 3rd bolts. \"Sideway dyno\" was almost static for me and didn't feel that hard. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hunter got the first bolt up and I pulled the crux. Only did to the first anchor but should come back and try again for the full · Lead / Redpoint. To the 2nd anchor. Onsite from between the 1st anchor and 2nd · TR. First time trying full. Small gear at crux but not far below. Use hidden feet, move far right, L foot up to chip on far L, heave up to good hold. Use shitty foot for move R after clipping bolt (long draw?) · TR. Need to figure out tricky high foot move just after mantling up the dyno rail. Everything else seems pretty ok · Lead / Fell/Hung. Only to first anchor. Did all but 2 moves (sideways dyno past bolt 1, and stand up move to bolt 3). Got a purple metolius micro in the start, a blue metolius 0.2 after the 3rd bolt, and a 0.75 in the upper right crack before mussies). · Lead / Fell/Hung. Went to the top. Gear: bolts, 1, low anchor, 3, 2, .3, .2, bolts, purple rp + .1, optional .2 · Lead / Fell/Hung. crux goes without too much juice, but pistol squattin and underclinging got me cooked. with Harrison, Caroline, Sam, and Quincy. · Lead / Redpoint. Let’s gooooo. Two 11c’s one day, same day I got smacked down by an 11a and had to aid it LOL · Lead / Fell/Hung. Loved this one. Climbed it with Melissa, would come back for the send · Lead / Redpoint. Got scared and had to have a brush tossed up to me after the dyno, before I committed to the high step · Took it to the top. Bring rp for pro after second bolt. Reach up with right hand, then match left hand (after moving left foot) on the bread loaf; for the second half crux getting to the first bolt. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard, first time up this season. Hung at the dump for a bit · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hot. Had to yard on bolt 2. Bolt 3 went great tho! · Climbed supermodel but got the top crux. Step v high with left foot immediately, don't bother with right foot hold · Lead / Fell/Hung. merhhhhhh. after the Gaston remember to put your right foot on the knob, not the crimp. · Lead / Flash. Woohoo. Fun cruxes. Foot match is dope. Gotta come back for the full pitch. · TR. Did the dyno (oof). Pistol squat move was ok but the next move was tough for me. Fell several times · Lead / Fell/Hung. Index comp :) 1-hung at high step: use closer sidepull-pinch to get onto foot. R gaston high. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Little spicy up to first bolt - maybe stick clip next time. Dyno move easy when fully committed but couldn’t figure out the move right after the mantle. Would like to lead the long version next time but it started dumping. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Crux is after the dyno pulling up to the next bolt · Lead / Fell/Hung. maybe 6 whips up high. hopefully next go. oddly enough I onsited the crux · Follow. The static cross is hard, the dyno seemed like it goes pretty well · Lead / Redpoint. full chains send. started around 8:45 am with a high of 76. lower crux was in sun, upper one was not. · TR. Tried the sideways dyno once, but didn't feel like cheese-grating myself so I skipped it. The pistol-squat move at the second crux was also hard, but felt a little more doable · TR. the top crux is going at a higher percentage now. Getting better with the very top. · TR. Got the dyno move thing first try, but couldn’t do the next move into the rail, pulled through that and finished. Cool but hard pitch. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung through lower dunk crux, felt very improbable. Sent upper crux and fell at higher bolt · Lead / Redpoint. Second go of the season after I avoided it last season due to shoulder pain · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at dyno, pulled rope and proceeded to do the same thing.. it’s truly at my limit, conditions are vital. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on the dyno and second crux. Conditions where not the best. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell right after making the crux on the glassy fleet. Felt supper solid in the dyno and high foot. Nicole was on belay. · Lead / Fell/Hung. made it to the first chains but for stuck at the second crux. · Lead / Redpoint. got the full send to the 2nd chains! top move feels great with the left hand on the sloper. · TR. Hit dyno right away by climbing a bit high and jumping sideways. Fumbled a bit on high beta, which is just staying low and crunched. · TR. Right foot inside edge high and step up left high to the second left foot. Dyno off the middle foot and stick it. · Lead / Fell/Hung. One hung, fell at the dyno which was challenging. Need to use a normal sport draw at the hole. Probably don’t fall there, and crunch myself up with low hands. Right foot up then find spot to pull left foot up. From here, power stand into the rail. 1” and .75” where great beta. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Could not reach the sideways move and didn’t wanna dyno. The rest of the route was 4 stars · Lead / Redpoint. lead from initial chains, sent the whole thing. 68 degrees, 730 pm. felt great · 2 pitches. TR. tr solo. couldn't do move on first pitch. forgot to use thumb. feel many times at 2nd pitch crux but figured out beta · TR. Hard route. Edge right foot, with right hip against wall, before stepping up and high on left. Climb high and dyno down. · Lead / Fell/Hung. on lower crux, stretch before getting on. then press hard on right hand, lift left foot up high and push down.for upper crux, bring right hand onto sloper, move right foot over to ledge above the knob, left foot onto the small knob. left hand onto rail. then move left foot up on slick upwards sloping rail. right hand has a small crimp, push up on left foot, stabilize right foot for balance, then bring right hand to jug. place two pieces (black totems) before taking this on · TR. first time getting the whole thing clean on top rope I made it through the bottom crocs without too many issues and then up at the top Crocs moving onto the slab found some good beta with left foot on the side pole right hand on the slipper jug right foot tow hook left hand up into the bucket worked well for me. · TR. To first anchors. cant do the dyno after the pocketc nor the moves after. Once i get to the ~.1 sidecling the rest is ezpz · 2 pitches. Lead. Fell twice first go to first chains. Re-sent bottom second go then got stumped at the upper crux and came down · Lead. Yo-yo’d clean to tristens high point below the crux above the first chains, then lead the rest of the extension onsight. Need to lead from the ground next sesh for the send. · Lead / Redpoint. Not sure how I sent this. In my comfy shoes too. I guess it was a low gravity day · TR. Whacky route - L foot on rail, pull R shoulder in for step across. At slab high foot and pinch, R hand crimp. Rest went easier. · Lead / Fell/Hung. just short p1, got very sideways for the horizontal move but got that clean. fall after third bolt working out that sequence · Lead / Redpoint. Led the full thing today. Awesome! More fun than the first pitch. First try today but I toproped it once years ago. 70m does get you to the ground. · Lead / Onsight. Have looked at this every time i come to index stoked to only climb the slab once! So good! · TR. couldn't stick the Dyno. after second clip, try stepping up and right with right foot · Didn’t finish, wear shoes with more edge next time. Possible to pull on gear through cruxes. · Lead / Redpoint. First try this season. Very fun! Stopped at the first set of chains. · Lead / Fell/Hung. to first anchor, pistol squat with feet facing towards wall. do bear hug move moving feet high on 3rd bolt · Lead / Fell/Hung. Tried it with the extension. Crux sequence in the upper part felt harder than what was down low. · Lead / Fell/Hung. pulled on pistol squat move and left wards traverse. work on hip flexibility and foot work for upper part · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. W Elaine. Hilarious carabiner cam in hole. Iron crossy span - body smear fall into further R, catch L. No hands after. Then sequence up corner - R crimp, high LF into L overhead press. R corner, L crimp, RF right side crimp. LF match left side. RF high nub (body horizontal), LF prev press hold (finicky), R and L up corner. LF near RF nub to reach R to sp. Sent on TR after · TR. With Cassie - found alternate beta for post-dyno/mantle crux! (RF up on sloping edge) · Lead / Fell/Hung. With Jonah - gotta work the post-dyno/mantle high foot crux [BH: fukd .75]"

Either way, it is challenging. --- more 5.10 follows to a slabby rest position. Once at the roof, rev up the biceps & dance on across to an exposed perch. Once rested, pop the clutch and switch into crack mode. Punch it high before placing a piece, then hang on till the anchor. ***  Originally thought this was 5.12.

From Tuna Boaters anchor it is quite easy to TR most of the roof and lower sections.

On a slippery day that was p wet and slippery · Lead / Fell/Hung. The had to pull on draws through entering and out exiting the first flare · TR. couldn't do 1 move each on crux 1 and 2, rest went well. · Lead / Redpoint. Second go of the day! Tried Amandla two years ago a time or two but barely remembered any beta other than wiggle and trust your feet. I hadn’t been on the upper half of the route before today, so classic! · Lead / Redpoint. Finally figured out all the trickery. Double send day with batskins. Stick clipped the first bolt and prehung the draw on the second. Hung all the rest on the send go. No kneebars or knee pads. What a climb! · Lead / Redpoint. Low crux is darn hard and the rest is darn good · TR. Just tried the start up to where Comfortably joins in. Pretty savage moves. Did the moves with TR assist, but should probably find better tall person beta. Right hand in upper bad seam was good to being left hand up to shoulder press · TR. Got crux at bottom like 4th try? Feel like I can do this with a lil work · Lead / Redpoint. Multi session proj! Used the OG grease stem beta. One of the coolest pitches of my life. · TR. fell a bunch but first time on it. the sun was out and the holds were getting hot. the bottom press fell doable with work. top flair felt very hard. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Second route at index; predictably got smacked. Lots of smearing and palming and small hold-ing. Cruxes low getting feet up and just below roof? Go right · TR. Really hard! Pulled all but one of the dihedral moves. The middle crux I layback with only one foot on the side · Lead / Fell/Hung. hahaha. HARD. hang diggidy dawg. did most of the moves. got flipped upside down going for the chains and decided to stick clipp/yard through the final section. probably more fun in Washington than in Florida."

I didn't overthink anything, and just focused on climbing, no success or failure in mind. Flew up iron horse really smoothly, and just perfectly executed the amandla arete. Might be the finger training and the squats I've been doing. Opted for the lay back version at the top, but came down and did the other version as well. · TR. Mid 40s and sunny. Fell twice, one on moving up after the span, second at top. · TR. 2nd TR. 2-3 falls. Got from entry to two hands on the arete before Falling. · TR. 43 degrees, cloudy. 3-5 pm. Fell on first entry move, got next section clean. Good warm up · Lead / Redpoint. Through the roof to the ledge, few tries this year, with some tries going back to 2020 ish! · TR. High of 71, humidity of 50%. Started at 1030,was way too slick. I fell a bunch at every move, first time on since October. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on this. Finished this up then went into the parking lot and saw the fire trucks for Michal's accident.will never forget this day. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 92 percent humidity. fell at 2nd bolt.slipped off. for Crux at top, get right hand in the slot right below crack. bring left foot up to left foot chip, then left hand stabilize along arete, then right hand into bottom slot. left hand above it grabbing arete. transition right hand to a side pull as you move left foot around to the nub. · TR. sent on top rope for fifth time in a row. hadn't climbed in a week, didn't feel strong, but was able to send it with the final lieback beta. non lieback approach is now solved, so much easier than I was making it. lieback is definitely a grade harder. at top, bring right hand up into lower flare, left foot onto lower left arete foot chip. left hand spans out to hold lower flare, left foot comes around onto nub. right foot onto upper right nub. right hand goes to arete just above flare, left hand into flare like lieback, then span right hand out right. bring left foot up to nub, tighten core, move left hand out up arete, bump it once more, then lieback on the left hand. · TR. sent it on TR (4th straight time). clearly the issue is lead head due to the bad fall potential on the last bolt, pressure of \"needing\" to send, plus the weird rope positions created when leading where it could get behind your feet. on TR it feels pretty wired. · Lead. high of 70, partly sunny, 5 pm. very humid. fell at 3rd bolt, just felt super weak from lack of sleep and inconsistent diet. was hard to give a strong lead attempt. · Lead / Fell/Hung. took a 40 min rest after first burn. slipped getting into the nub. may want to consider the finish most people do to avoid pump and last boulder problem. got pumped out after working it and moving the rope over the comfortably numbah ten. probably would have been okay if I didn't do the additional comfortably rope work. · Lead / Fell/Hung. perfect temps, high of 64. got up to last move onto the nub, got right foot caught in the rope and fell. · TR. sent for 3rd time on TR. without rope issues behind the legs, it's straight forward · Lead. high of 79. 5:15 pm. fell at 3rd bolt transferring before I got onto major foot nub. major issue was it's hard to get foot up once the draw has the rope running through it. may need to bring left foot up slightly prior to make this easier. then had issues on the lieback, out of gas. need to rest more at rest spot. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 80% humidity, cloudy, temperature of 70°. everything went smoothly until clipping. the Alpine draw on the fourth bolt. got the foot match at the first bolt by keeping arms level and not reaching up until the foot match was complete. got the right foot onto the big nub by bringing the right hand over directly below the arete foot dish and pulling directly sideways, not up. this is critical to only pull sideways. when clipping the last Alpine draw, pull out the slack before standing up on the left foot. then come down and take another rest. focus on getting the feet in the right spot so you don't get the foot stuck behind the rope. · Lead / Redpoint. Did this variation after being thwarted by Amandla many times. Such fantastic climbing · TR. high of 72, did it in the evening about 7 pm. got the foot transfer beta right: don't move left hand up the arete before foot match. complete foot match, then move both hands up, shift weight to the left and move up. simple this way · TR. sent it on TR!!! got the foot match correct using tc pros (first try was in pinks but TCs feel a bit better). make sure to move hands up the arete and the left foot up before trying to get up onto the big knob. liebwcking the arete was straight forward. · Lead / Fell/Hung. started at 910, sunny, high of 76. arete felt very warm and slick. the past week of 90+ must have warmed the rock up a lot. felt super greasy, fell on foot transfer 3-4 times. make sure right toe is above left foot and pushes down to get clean transfer. needs cool day so right hand is good. also, but long double sling on iron horse chains to keep rope out of your foot space. bring up an extra 0.75 if you need to go up to Sagittarius chains. everything felt slick, I felt weak. need better sleep and more training in the week leading up to trying it. · TR. high of 80, started around 10 am, no cloud cover. too hot to lead. one fall on the lieback up to the good nub. sent the top section. tried Jeremy's beta of moving right, just doesn't work for me. liebacked the arete 4 times in a row, no problem never fell. the key is to bring right foot up on arete high, almost at the base of the crack, the bring left foot onto nub on the left arete. makes the right foot transfer and the hand transfer in the pocket much smoother. sinking the right foot, getting the knee over, standing up with right hand up to bread loaf worked perfectly. · TR. high of 80, no cloud cover. did 2nd try at 1130 or so. arete was very hot, slipped off lots of places. but even in the heat sent everything above the last bolt!!! · Lead / Fell/Hung. fell at last move. need to remember, grab final bread loaf with right hand. left hand doesn't work. stand up after right hand on bread loaf, with left leg and hand splayed out to the left. · Lead / Fell/Hung. started at 9:15, high of 76. cloudy, arete fully shaded. took 30 ft whipper on last move. need to remember to get knee fully over foot and really sink into it. · TR. sent it all the way from the bottom of arete (after foot match!). stayed focused and fought for it the whole way. · TR. started at 945 am. high of 78 degrees. moderate cloud cover, was in the sun but somewhat covered when I got on. fell on entry sequence, but after that was smooth up until the final move to the bolt. fell about a half second after I started thinking I would send it. need to stay in the mental headspace of really wanting it and being 100% focused on executing each move. on foot match moving into the arete, make sure right big toe is down and making contact. · TR. Tried it in the morning sun, 11 AM, 70+% humidity. Couldn't get the first move, as the right hand relies on friction to keep you stable while you move up the arete with the left. Got the sequence from bolt 1 to bolt 2 clean, fell on the right foot up to the big knob. The beta here is to bring the right hand up sideways onto the foot chip, which has enough roughness to give good friction. Add body tension, Then move left foot up 2-3 inches,and throw right foot up and lean down on it. Upper last move was ok, but quite slick due to heat. Probably will need to try later in the year when it is cooler. · TR. got all moves pretty easily. on entry to arete, grab side arete before swapping feet. then move left foot up, bump left hand up, shift weight over left foot, lift right hand up to side pull, then move up. was 80% humidity, felt really slick. 5.10 pinks felt better than tc pros. for moving onto big nub at 3rd bolt, place left foot low, bring right hand over and lean back to create tension, move left foot up 6 inches, then move right foot up and pistol squat on the right foot. · TR. TR, got all the moves pretty easily. on the third bolt, when getting the right foot turned towards the left, move left hand up as far as you can. position left foot with ankle out and toe pushing into the arete which gives a good counter balance to prevent the barn door. bring right hand above left onto the arete and layback the right foot up onto the good foothold. rest. clip. do move out and around. added an additional draw to make the clipping stance safer from right foot on chip. follow same lieback beta as before. · TR. got all the moves. for entry onto arete, match feet in slot before moving left hand out from side pull to arete. the pull up onto left foot is fine. bump right hand up. move left foot up to nub, right foot into near small crystal pocket. bump right hand again. get solid left hand on arete, find good hold, then put right foot facing left as you pull on it. then lieback and move left foot up, bringing right foot up again to major knob. swing around arete is fairly easy. clip from over there is difficult. move left foot up, right foot onto nub. reach left hand into slot, then bring right hand to grab it as a pinch. lieback up the arete, then move right foot over and sink it into foot. left leg around arete for balance, stand up slowly and grab horn. · Lead / Fell/Hung. got the first two bolts just fine. best way for getting to 3rd bolt still isn't clear. clipping 4th bolt is scary because you're in a lieback and pumped with no feet. not sure how to do it yet. took a few whips, linebacking after 4th bolt is also tenuous and the fall is a bit uncertain, I flipped over slightly coming down and hit my back on the arete but no damage. · TR. got all moves before transferring back onto the arete from left side. put left toe onto dish on left side just above the mini roof, then transfer right foot over to nub and weight it. sink body down to get weight then pull up. wrap left leg around arete to keep balance as you stand. did it in 67 degrees and 60%+ humidity. need to try it when it's 55 or 60 and less humid. feels 100% doable to send! · TR. for the last big nub before getting to the arete, lieback arete facing the arete and bring right foot up · Lead / Fell/Hung. very hot day, slick holds. it's easy to clip the first bolt for me from the corner. the second seems doable from the right foot on the crystal and left leg heel hooking the arete if draws are already there. couldn't get past bolt 2, was just crazy hot and I slid right off. felt completely different than last try where it was hard but doable. ideal temps are probably sunny and 50. · TR. incredible. can't wait to get on it again. top ropes it from comfortably numbah ten."

The Princely Ambitions area is basically the first part of the Main Wall you pass directly by on the main trail.

At the top of the flakes, follow a chalked-up ledge traversing left and then straight up the corner all the way to the belay (bolts). The pitch is long, so don't give up on the anchor, it is there.Avoid the temptation to finish at the \"Nobody tosses a dwarf\" anchors, which are partway up the final corner, just a little to the right. If you do this early exit, you miss some fun, relatively easy corner climbing. Instead, continue until the corner ends at a large comfy ledge.P2 (5.8) Continue up the left crack to a rap station.From the top of P2, you can continue up and left through the trees to the Winky Dinky cliff.",

One of the best climbing routes I’ve done. Awesome flakes the whole way up · 1 pitch. Lead / Flash. Only one pitch, finished at the bolted anchor at top of Nobody Tosses a Dwarf. Backcleaned a piece at the traverse to reduce drag. · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. First pitch only. So close to an onsight, took a 15-20 foot fall on an extended purple totem · Lead / Flash. Haley led pitch 1. Brought doubles .1-3. Triples .3-.5. Lots of alpine draws. Max led the second pitch. Pretty cool climb! · Follow. Julian P1 (extend the first piece or back clean after the bolt, same with the hairpin) sg p2. Cont to beak beak beak · Lead / Onsight. W Andrew. Soo fun. Would like to link both pitches next time. · Follow. Pitch 2 was WORTH. Got some solid jams in a beautiful hand crack · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. With tj! Rapped with 70 and downclimbed the last little bit. · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Pretty speedy climb, felt solid the whole way, got dark belaying second, and on descent · TR. Such a fun climb! Very exposed and airy. I guess it’s 5.9…? But like… also what the hell in no world is that a 5.9 anywhere but index · Lead / Flash. Remember not to plug a 3 behind the huge flake. Low traverse right to V slot before horizontal hand rail traverse out left. Plug black totem and commit, then mantle. Bring long slings. Sustained, fun corner moves to finish. 70m rap from top of p1 requires down climbing big ledge · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. New fav. Surreal. Got to the top with mount index peaking through a cloud scarf with the moon above. Felt like a breezy fairytale. · 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. Better than last time. Can’t tr from top oop had to downclimb to lower anchors · Lead. With Ethan, I feel like I placed well and had a nice time. · 1 pitch. TR. Top roped. Strength wise could potentially lead it with takes. Very long. 70m only works if you belay from the ledge above. · 1 pitch. TR. Asked another group to trail a rope up for us to TR. Belayed from upper ledge with 70m, barely long enough. V glad I did not lead it, hard! Really fun and great movement, awesome climb. · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Stopped at first anchor, from there it's 35m to ground · Follow. Climbed with Will and Kevin. First pitch is hard and a lil reachy/physical for \"5.9\"! · Lead / Onsight. Lead first, TR second. Stellar first pitch!! Deserves all the stars for varied movement, and just enough spice to keep it real. · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. first climb in Index ! properly put in my place · 1 pitch. Lead / Flash. Little tricky but super fun. Peter mantled the finger traverse on top rope! · Lead / Redpoint. Engaging courageous memorable climb with several cruxy/emotionally engaging sections. Would recommend. 2nd pitch sketch loose rock and questionable anchor. · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Just the first pitch. Rope drag bad. Bolt at end of ledge traverse bad. · Follow. Erron led. SO scary! Neither of us fell...felt like I was going to many times. Would be awesome to lead one day, felt at my limit on TR. The traverse left was the scariest. Then finger crack was pretty solid. · Lead / Onsight. Love that first pitch. Reminder not to put gear in on the right side of the traverse. Too much drag and hard for the follower. · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Just to p1 and lowered for the end of the day, very scary hollow flakes but a full on fun trad route · 1 pitch. Follow. Still scary. Gotta come back to lead this one. Beta for the part before the traverse. Stay left. Stand on very top of flake. Step down right to foot ledge both feet. Reach far right and up for jug · Lead / Onsight. best pitch of 5.9 i’ve ever done! feels like an alpine or big wall pitch, very exciting! ran out of slings at the end but rope drag was not bad. swapped leads with Alice and she cruised p2. gonna come back for the 10d crack variation and the 10d slab pitch above. · Follow. Keep your damn feet on the wall after the first bolt going right onto the rail. Or maybe do something completely different than dangling your legs and doing a pull-up. Then comes the lie back right. Pull onto 2x2 flake. Careful feet get you to the top right of the 7. Again keep feet on the wall and ledge / finger crack trav until in reach of vertical crack for after the right foot mantle. Does not let up here!!! Compose and protect and find the best holds and feet. Big ledge at the top on the right. Followed Eric today but will lead one day. Index=gnar · Lead / Redpoint. Lead p1 could do 2x bt-3 plus offset cams and nuts (one mid & big), only 1x#1. Revolver before traverse and on bolt (but locker on bolt would feel better). Use 2x #3 early and 2x #2 before big flake mantle. follow Deanna on p2. Rap to starting ledge and downclimb · Lead / Onsight. w/ Keira. Led Pitch 2. Pitch 1, some reachy, scary moves on the slab. · Lead / Flash. Kinda tough! The holds and moves are all there but a number of committing stuff. #0.2-3 with double 0.3-2, mostly 0.3-0.5, placed the 0.2 above the first bolt. One double alpine at the very right before left hand rail traverse, otherwise single alpines and draws, no nuts. · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. P1 only as a warmup. Fun n chill.

Climbed with Brian Rajdl. Linked into 5.10a Breakfast of Champions, awesome link-up! · Lead / Flash. Aleah led to the first anchors, and then I led the top. Def not 5.9 · Lead / Fell/Hung. was a little wet in some of the cracks. took multiple times. gave a couple attempts at starting the crux at the end but ultimately decided to bail before the overhung hand crack/last stemmy bit. should be able to finish next time! needed lots of extensions · Lead / Redpoint. Finished off the lead for Theresa through the crux. Fairly cruiser-ish until stemming. Middle section is more engaging though than I ever remember it to be. Probably want to encourage new leaders to save a 1 and/or 0.75 for the top. · Lead / Onsight. Fun route, kinda tricky to project without crazy drag. Lots of ledges so running it out not advised. Placed two cams at crux and had to back clean before belaying up Anna due to drag. To first chains is just ok, crus has fun movement. Would be tough to link with BOC unless you run it out, bring triples in hands. · Follow. Got the TRonsight. Fists/butterfly didn’t last long because you could get high feet. · Lead. This was my pre-injury goal for the year. I am so proud of myself. · Lead / Flash. Haley lead, max followed to get to BOC. Felt like a great lead for me. Pretty sporty but also somewhat physical. Couple spots you have to trust feet. · Lead / Onsight. Pretty fun imo. Linked the pitches to base of breakfast of champions. Spaced out pro and had no rope drag. Some loose stuff but not bad. I found it really enjoyable. · Lead / Redpoint. Felt hard after a day of doing lots of climbing. Fuel up & bring enough food for doing sustained powerful climbing. · Lead / Fell/Hung. would definitely carry a 4 inch cam next time. took 20ft whip while clipping, oof · Lead / Redpoint. Fun on top half, being extra hand size piece and alpine draws · Follow. Possibly just as hard with a heavy backpack to head up to mid wall on as on lead. ~Pumpy~ was almost feeling to gassed to fire up BOC. · Lead. Well not quite as easy on lead but still ok. A few awkward body positions, especially getting into the upper corner. Used singles 0.3-4 plus an extra 0.75 and a 0.4/0.5 offset but there are options. · Follow. Followed Roger up Roger’s Corner. He was scared leading it. I was scared following · Lead / Flash. So I LOVE this climb. Did it 3 times this summer :) a little pumpy at the end tho! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Freaked out at upper bulge. It’s all there, just stay left, get a high 2, and move quickly. · Lead / Onsight. fun. spicy move off the mid anchors. felt on the harder side of 9. · Follow. Jillian’s lead. Felt good to follow. Stayed fully in the corner on upper crux and it was pretty chill. · Follow. W/ Gus. Very fun follow. No way I could lead. Linked with Breakfast of Champions. Stopped at the first anchor to ensure we had enough gear. · Lead. One take 10 ft from the anchor, not a super hard climb at all · Lead. felt easier than in 2020, however had a really heavy rope which made drag bad at the time"

Cruxed out low establishing into the crack. Went back down & taped, did again from ground, took just a bit before chains due to pump. Super fun, protects great. · Lead. .2, 1x .4-.75 (+graylien), 2x 1-4. All the slings. Place 4 right side of roof. Extension seems to take finger to medium. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Save .75s and .5s and a few 1s for top. Didn’t use the 3s at the top- could use both at the bottom. Two or three 4s and a 5 for sure. Extend everything at the bottom and after the traverse make sure to put the rope around the horn/ flake to reduce drag · TR. Woof - lots of fun varied climbing, look around for jugs / feet · Lead / Pinkpoint. Cleaned first half for Ben. Led to the top chains to TR · Lead / Pinkpoint. Half pink, half red. Sent it after Brandon couldn't finish it after getting in his head. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to take at the start of the traverse. Got to the offwidth ok but didn’t have enough gear and got in my head. Also had the rope running over the flake. Bailed off a loose flake. Feels bad man. Save a 4 or 5 for after the traverse. Run the rope under the flake. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Wimped out didn’t finish! Used right lower flake due to greasy feat on left flake · Lead / Fell/Hung. Didn't manage effort well and had to hang up top in the paddles/fstacks · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell hung before first crux and getting in to hand crack · Lead / Fell/Hung. Spectacular climbing, would like to come back and send, it was a hard warm up, but I had to hang a rope on iron horse · Lead / Fell/Hung. Whipped at start of traverse then just epiced the whole way. Need to work on size 4 technique. · Lead / Onsight. Mostly just intimidating, good climbing! Don’t stop at the first anchor - nice layback for another 15 ft · Lead / Fell/Hung. First lead attempt. Did it 99% clean, then grabbed the chains at the very end :'( Definitely more type 2 fun on lead (still great). Need to figure out a better plan for the layback, not enough of a brave boy to just run it out · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 (real) fall at bulge coming out of squeeze after committing to the lie back from the face hold, 2 takes in the upper liebacks. 0.5 in the flaring layback at bottom (extend this piece with full single+mini extend next 0.3 when finger crack first accepts this, only one #3 necessary #3 BD pulling into hand crack, bump this up to slung chock At slung chock, reach far back to use it as good hold to rest on Get up higher to chalked jug block, place #4, then can rest by jamming upper arm between the big undercling roof and the jug block, bump #4 over, find the feet, then make handless traverse to transfer to other side of roof Gooood rest in the upper squeeze after it flared out, find the good foot to depump calf with a left frog leg (hands free, relaxed), a couple hand fist stacks to pull over the weird #5 section and place/shove the #4 into ringing flake before pulling face move. #1 at bottom after squeeze/#4 Commit to balance-y lieback can’t sneak thumb jammed in on bottom hand, too narrow, then don’t forget about foot rail out left after a couple moves plus finger jam in flake, eventually getting to hand jams above flake #2 BD midway through in hands section, rest with feet in flake and rail #1 up high before bulge right before committing to the last section #0.75 midway up final layback, continue on, then another #0.75, can get foot over to left side to clip chains Final gear (in order): 0.2, 0.5ext (totem), 0.3exthalf, 3BD, chock+single, 4, 5, 4, 1, 2BD, 1, 2*0.75 (maybe extra #1 for this section?) · TR. Amazing route. Every kind of bullshit I love in one climb. Can't wait to go back and lead it · Lead / Fell/Hung. Black totem to pull over first blocky terrain, 0.5 or 0.75 (if so bring triples) in flaring layback, extended (did on sliding x because wet) 0.3 in finger up top 2 friend (almost tipped out) or 3 BD pulling into baggy hand crack 3 up higher in this? 4 midway through traverse at the tooth hanging down bit of the roof Can reach across to gaston just barely 5 pulling into squeeze, take it all the way up 4 in ringing flake before reaching outside to key hold with right hand 0.75-2 multiple in the upper for the hand cracks (wider crack below, baggy 0.75s splitter up top), all layback ish. · Lead / Redpoint. Lead to first anchor to set up TR on IH. Start with .5 in flare · Lead / Redpoint. perfectly 3 years ago. finally got the repoint. remember to face out on the chimney. 1 #5 and 1 #4 is enough. not sure how to place the first #3 so the rope doesn't get caught. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Whipped on a 4 right below the blue tat. Took 1 other time · TR. Partner didn’t want to follow, so I had to clean it somehow and sure as hell wasn’t gonna do it as I was getting lowered · Lead / Fell/Hung. Great climb but very physical and hard for me. Whipped on the lower finger crack, fell on the wide stuff, was pumped for the final layback Double rack, 2 #4, 1 #5, save your .75s till the very end · Follow. With marius. Someone go put the cleaning biner back on the sling, i grabbed it thinking it was my partner's, put it down at the base of the climb · Lead / Fell/Hung. Intimidating from the ground considering the whipperfest 3 years ago but I made it nearly to the chain until I slipped at the final layback. My body felt like I was HIIT training, full body pump. Got a lot of spray on gear placement from the ground. Thankful but a lot of faff. Bit improvement from 2020. Single .3-.5, 4-5. Double .75- 2. · Lead / Onsight. So stoked to get the onsight of this! Such a rad climb. It worked me. Liebacked the big roof thing (next time should traverse across low feet. Struggled R side in chimney (Bjorn goes left in which makes more sense). At the top plugged a #1 (2nd #1 at top section would be nice) liebacked the 1 section and barely made it to the chains before pumping out! Would have been an exciting fall. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung at lieback. Had the strength to do it, purely a wimp. Rest a cruise. · Lead / Redpoint. Finally sent 11b variation. No 5, but .4 to .75 fits in back of offwidth just fine · Follow. fcking hard, didnt help that multiple cams stuck. Wicked hard for 5.10, but I’m just bad at sustained offwidth jam crack. Clipping long sling and going rope over the flake seems like the best beta · Lead / Fell/Hung. 11 roof extension. Felt strong but foot popped. Pulled back on and sent next go. .75 and black totem (optional but nice). Prep text the top. .75 slots all the way in on the top of the good hold out right · Lead / Onsight. neat. looked at going out the roof, looked a bit dirty and cruxy on an upside down pin · Lead / Fell/Hung. w yev. fell several times at the first fist crack. layback the top crack before the anchors, don't try to jam · Lead / Onsight. So sick!!! Stopped at anchors bellow roof but it was a blast. · TR. I fell a bunch of times, definitely something I want to work up to · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took a sec to figure out the middle and top crux · Lead. Another burn on this to hang iron horse but bailed at the first anchors cuz wet up high. The bottom 3 crack is hard · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 big fall, several hangs. start w/black and blue totems followed by .5 soon after. extended #3 under small roof to the left. #4 and #3 up to chockstone. 2x #4 to traverse under roof, extend second over flake. #5 up chimney to leave at top with yellow alien. 2x #1 after exit, then 2x #2, then 2-3x .75. · TR. Led the upper section past the first anchors, felt good up there. Lower section still feels sketch · TR. Clean, fun, low thin fingers are crux. Possibly bring triples of hand sizes and no nuts. · Lead / Fell/Hung. took on the last 0.75 crack. Gosh, the layback is so good what was I thinking. It was also my first time taking the finger crack up, much better than the flare. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell attempting 11b extension. Took a few large whips and ended up needing to cut my rope after destroying the sheath. Got it on the 4th try though. Gear note: Lots of alpine draws, At least 8 fully extended. .5 protects the roof. Clip the pin otherwise the fall is scary (but safe). Iffy .75 protects the top out. · Lead / Fell/Hung. double rack to #4. start on finger crack. I placed #4 too far to left on roof traverse, which caused drag. optional #5 for chimney. · Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Jess and hung a top rope?? Date is wrong · Lead / Redpoint. Got it. End was every bit as desperate as last time · Lead / Fell/Hung. Sagged off the last 5 feet, d’oh! Rad climb. With joe · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell and took a couple times. To second chains. Almost vomited on top lol"

Also bring 4 purples and more than one.4 Very tricky finish · Follow. Had to aid entrance moves but beta is to walk plank, use thumbercling, kick out. Rest was pumpy but great fingers! · Follow. Followed Billy - basically sent it! Top move was tough. Gorgeous day before the comp · Lead / Fell/Hung. Blew the flash on the last move. Good rock climbing, high in the grade.

Sooooo good, one of the best I’ve done anywhere, amazing crack with several angle switches to keep it interesting. With Con · Lead / Fell/Hung. SO FUN!!! Perfect size for my hands. Fell at the switch left to the side pull before final groove and then at the top mantle ofc. Would totally do it again · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on the last 15ft section as the crack thinned out - need to work through the thing fingers beta. Next time! · TR. Man this would be a proud lead. Final mantle to the anchors would feel desperate oof. · Lead / Redpoint. Have gotten in the past with the backstep left foot at the top. Wear pants or rubber knee pads. Beta beginning bring offset and have to kinda levitate to first good jamb. Middle section arete I have to keep gear on left crack, reach over from right crack.

Roof pod section is all footwork w feet and hands left off and on. Bring (4).4 and .3 Nothing bigger than .75. Do Tommy’s sandbox above soon! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got 20' from the chains and gassed out, causing a significant whip. Very sustained fingers all the way with a couple of decent rests bout a 1/3rd up, but the upper 2/3's is full commitment.

One slip making pedestal. Stuff arm right. Then led slow children plus lap - very fun! End worked well with left leg stuff and right foot back step! Lovely! With Hasib · Lead / Fell/Hung. Heartbreaker of a finish... took 8-10 feet from the anchors as I ran out of gear. Would have spit off trying to traverse/mantle anyway, with a long run out.

Was literally touching the nub in the left when my feet blew and I took a whip down to the last rest… my self reslung purple link cam held tho! Whipped 3 times and finally managed to grab the nub. It’s all in getting your feet as high as possible and trusting them as you stand up on a shitty finger lock to reach the nub. Only used .3s-.5s wish I had more .3s lol · Lead / Redpoint.

Climbed with Cameron in my first lead of 24! I took three or four times but I did slowly make it up. This pitch beat me up with the sustained fingers but it still feels possible.

Fell on tr Ben crushed the lead but whipped as well. Stem the final bit above the toof · Lead / Redpoint. Lead with TJ. Cleaned the needles and did a couple TRS laps too. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Wild fall after hand grabbed the last hold. It’s too long of a stretch. Save a black totem for the end. 3 .5, 3, .4, 3 .3. Bigger nuts might come in handy at the top · 2 pitches.

Amazing climb · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lots of falls at the top. Wear pants and try knee scum thing next time · Follow. Climbed with Karthik. Feel mostly ready to come back and lead it outside of that final move - which is gnarly. Hah the final move did a number on my fingerpads. Also remember to bring two double length slings to extend when going right next time. · Lead / Fell/Hung. At top Bottom straight up with shoulder skum right .2 -2 .3 -4-5 .4 - 4-5 .5 3-4 2 .75 · Lead / Fell/Hung. black tri-cam after bolt. fell at top, should have walked my feet higher and reached for the jug instead of continuing up the crack. · Follow. Top was crux for me, although move off bottom flake was tricky too. Did after city park p2 and Godzilla. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Great sustained finger crack. I thought it felt quite hard for the grade 5.11b. I ran out of small cams which meant I had to place a nut mid crux. The final moves were certainly harder than the starting moves, and I fell on the nut. Even after hanging I found the finish to be near my limit and slippery. · Lead. fingers to 0.75, with many 0.3-0.5. Also takes medium nuts well. placed an offset 0.2/0.3 up high, but don't really need anything smaller than 0.3. To sew it up: 4 0.3, 4 0.4, 2 0.5, 1 0.75 and medium nuts. · Lead / Fell/Hung.

Climbed it like an OW on TR and it felt pretty easy. · 2 pitches. TR. TR'd 2 laps, bottom crux is balancey and scary, middle crux is pumpy, top crux has secret beta. Partner used OW technique, I used left heel hook · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on the last moved! Had my hands on the mantle but was too pumped to pull it. Stinger in the tail! · TR. this feels way easier now. the last part is to just get your right hand as high as possible. get your right foot as high as possible and then quickly spring for the jug · Follow. Really nice line. Finger crack with a scary plank walk at the very beginning · Lead / Fell/Hung. Quadruple .3 and .4 was nice. Having 3 left for the top out is nice, but 2 would work. Double .5 and .75 with no need to save them. Direct start feels safer and better than the plank. Used a few offset nuts. Small peanut helpful for previous pitch (or large micro offset, perhaps gold dmm offset) · TR. TRS. 2 laps. Final sequence is crux, very long reach real once crack tapers."

I've heard this variation called \"Sushi Farmer\" and you'll want whatever gear you like on P1 Stern, plus a hand and finger cam and a few long slings. If both of these climbs were already 4-stars, this variation is off the end of the quality scale. P2 Stern Farmer ~5.12a - A mellow finger lock and a compression move or two lead to a powerful pull establishing up into the chimney/stem. There's a good-looking fixed head you can clip before the crux unless your're short. Since this crux might result in fall to the p2 belay stance, consider linking p1+p2 or lowering the belayer to a nice no-hand stance a few meters beneath the anchor. After getting into the chimney, a good fixed wire ( and later 2 fixed pins) protect tenuous flare chimney work, using knobs for feet, the hardest move is at mid height where there are no knobs for a second and your chicken wing skills get a test. Pull out of the chimney on a jug rail ( small cam) and face climb straight left past a bolt to the anchors atop p1 J. Gardens (VAR) or mantle up and right, joining P2 of batskins below the .11d crux move, (the 'fixed' heads all fell out in 2014) and finish via that pitch, which ends 10-15m directly above the anchors of p1 J gardens.

First time on it today. Figured everything out except the traverse into the seam. Crack seems doable, should be doable if I can figure out the entry moves · Lead / Redpoint. LETS GO DUDE!!! I think 4th go of the day my god · 2 pitches. Lead. Lead up to the jug pocket or just under it I can’t remember. Then to the top with a lot of falls on the big layback press move. Then a tr burn to sus it all out. Seems like I can always make it to the jug pocket but my fingers are dying by that point · TR. Yess felt soo much better this time around. Got all the way to the jug pocket · Lead / Fell/Hung. Sweating buckets even on a headlamp burn… ready for crispy fall temps · Lead / Fell/Hung. .4, black nut, 2, 4 Locker draw, black totem, blue totem, blue tcu/black totem, yellow totem, black totem, blue totem, anchor · TR. Fell after establishing and moving up. Need to alternate feet in corner and just wriggle upwards · TR. Got into slot, fell moving right foot up after I stabilized in the slot.may need to just use right foot in crack vs slabbing up arete · Lead / Redpoint. Got it! Second attempt of the day, which I am pretty proud of. First attempt I fell moving into the clock tower moves. Found a better stance to place the .3 before the clocktower and was able to squeak it out. · TR. Clean for the first time. I suppose I need to start leading it now. Arm bars help a lot in the slot. · TR. Fully on the struggle bus, couldn't figure how to do most of the moves - fingers don't fit! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Not so bad this time, but still fafing through the middle. Found a cute heal toe can which might be useful standing up to the .5 pod. .2, .3, .3, .4, .3, .2 is all you could want, so whole rack from bottom is 2x .2, 3x .3, 2x .4, .5, 3. And ack nut with alpine draw. Three draws for the .4, 3, and bolt · Lead / Fell/Hung. Pretty poor showing. Able to get into the corner well. Have a problem really standing up into first good hand hold still. Perhaps need better betta there. Had problems with the crescent hand moves as well. Gear, 2x black, 2x blue, 1/2x yellow totems is plenty. Maybe an extra purple/blue metolius for good luck. A .1/.2 offset cam would be nice to protect the hand foot match section very well. Just make sure to place it above the sidepull. Beta note to self, getting the .5 placement with the right hand and the crimp with the left is better since it allows you to rest the left while moving up / placing gear since the next section is left hand heavy. · Lead / Redpoint. With Lukasz. Incredible. What a climb!! 7 TR laps, 10th lead go. · TR. Got all the moves. Perhaps ready to start leading. Gear looks very good. · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. With Josh. 1 fall on both attempts! Peeled off 2 moves before the jug on second attempt lmao · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. With Derrick. 2 falls on first attempt, 3 falls on second attempt. · Finally went for it on lead. One hang!! Pretty stoked about the effort. Got thru first crux fell in palm press. Feet not high enough. Right hand in last good finger lock, left hand crimps just above it, find intermediate foot nub for right and walk feet as high as possible on left until can get left foot on the knob. And need palm a little higher on the feature, then bring right foot on and stem. Gear was good!! Just lots of .2-.3. Really only need black totem (could skip), blue totem, .2, then After crux, .3,.5, black totem. Other stuff would work here too · Lead / Fell/Hung. With Luke, Vadim, and Aidan. Took some small whips and did all the moves on lead so I guess it's a good start. · Lead / Redpoint. Tried to get some sushi on send burn but couldn’t quite stick it · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. 2 falls. Gun for upper left crimp after traverse, race up pods to good fingerlock w LF prev crimp. Then swap for R lock, L crimp above (don’t block). R palm, feet walk high left (horizontal) until R palm highest/best part. L skip shitty to highest pod. RF match R hand for stem; place gear. Gear: start - singles .5-3. Stern: .1-.4 · 2 pitches. Right hand highest pod before crux, left foot high, left hand to pod that's never chalked a few inches below super chalked up pod, right foot way out right, right hand up to decent pod · TR. got all the moves figured out! getting into flare: right hand on arete, left hand up to the circular bump. right foot over to lower dish. slowly transition weight around arete, stick left foot into corner or on small sloper just right of corner. right core to not barn door. then move left hand up into small finger lock. scum right foot, move left foot up in flare. reach up for good finger lock. rest is just tricky. when moving right hand up to good flare before moving out right, go into pinscar just below big finger pocket, leave that for left hand. · TR. Transition: R bump 5 o’clock from bolt, RF smear into kneebar. LF drop down into crack, L crack below bump. RF smear out right on white. Scum body against wall to bump LF up for R next pod. L crimp on face. R pod, then L good pinscar. R palm crescent, LF high to reach L to next pod. Easy after jug · TR. 1 hang on tr. gotta remember to use right foot on face during palm press. maybe give it a lead go soon · Lead / Fell/Hung. Excuses: I’m sick, tired, and it’s end of the day. Fell a couple times at both cruxes. Gear was easy. 1 or 2 black totems between cruxes, .2 above 2nd crux (black totem too big) · TR. Lead dis. Got moves dialed felt way easier than when it was 90 degrees · TR. first crux at knee bar/scum (get right foot kind of high and drop left - right hand on the pinchy crimpy knob, left hand crimpy/sidepoull the seam, get left foot up a little and wedge in crack, scum left arm like hell, scum right arm and crimp seam, work feet up til left foot gets on good edge and hit the good lock with the right. go a couple moves higher to the next good lock (go deep with right hand). slot a. bomber black totem In there. right hand in the good lock, left hand side pulling above, feet up, smear left foot on wall as hard as you can. try to get as high as possible. left palm press, right foot smear, left foot on the ticked knob.push that palm, hit the highest left crimp possible and get the right foot at the bottom of the palm press feature. right hand in the slot, work feet up, switch hands around and keep working feet up as high as you can and make desperate reach for jug. probably place a.2 or purp bettolius before going for jug. jug is better on left side. then another jug and then stand up and breath · Lead / Redpoint. Sessioned on TR with Mantas a few times, really fun process. Fired it off first lead go. · TR. After JG. Tough transition into crack: L fist, R sloper, RF smear into kneebar. Tips pods (best ones near nubby one); L crack, R palming arete to wiggle up. Crack gets better w smeary feet out right. Easy after good stance 3/4 up. · Lead / Redpoint. 2 years, 14th burn, lots of power screaming = first 5.12. I cried at the chains lol. · Lead / Redpoint. Felt impossible in 2015, finally did it on TR in 2020, then about 6 or 7 redpoint tries this year to get it. · Lead / Fell/Hung. One fall at stemming crux! go straight out to arete. black totem lower down, blue just below good pod. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1st lead burn! 1st 5.12 gear lead! high left hand. walk feet up arete for stemming. .5 grey 1 2 4 bolt .2 .3 .2 red/blue dmm .4 · TR. belayed by dad. starting to come together! from jg: traverse in at knob, one arete layback move to kneebar, \"fingerlock\", high lh, layback off thin lock to good lock. · TR. Traverse left lower, with finger pocket right. Layback up. Then grovel up. Then stem to reach pinky jams"

Wander up ledgy climbing above Japanese Gardens P2 towards the roofed base of the large, obvious curving flake. The climbing up to the roof gets progressively more difficult and the crux is moving left around the roof to where the flake curves upwards vertically and the crack behind it opens up more. This sequence is somewhat inobvious and powerful and the former fixed pin above the roof is gone now, although small gear protects adequately. The flake itself is fun, easier liebacking and crack climbing. From the top of the flake, a short \"sting in the tail\" slab section leads up and left past one bolt to the anchor atop P3 of TPMV.",

It was clear that there used to be a fixed piton at the crux, but it was gone at that time. Luckily small cams and maybe some small nuts are totally adequate protection. It might be good to have some small nuts or RPs as well, although I can't recall using them. The upper flake takes some larger gear. The rack required for Japanese Gardens with the addition of a couple of smaller widgets if you didn't already bring them should be perfect.

I recall doing the direct moves back in 07' after futile efforts to do the Lynn Hill stem solution on MW (most likely due to my lack of frontal plane hip flexibility).  At the time, I gave the direct a lead by climbing up to the eye bolt on MW, back down to the ground, and then climbing over right to the direct start...eventually falling and swinging way left to slam hard into the wall. I recall the climbing being brilliant but the fall absolutely terrible.I'm certainly not a fan of squeeze jobs and unnecessary bolting, but do believe the distance between the original MW line and Supermodel allows adequate breathing room. Moreover, the climbing is just SO awesome!!  I would imagine the grade is all over the place depending on body composition, skill, flexibility, height etc.  Felt like Index 5.12c to me.  The direct now has 2 bolts.

A couple top ropes and one lead burn. No knee pad. Blue metolius before the “palm crux”, black totem after, .4 protects the run to the chains, #2, .3. · Lead / Redpoint. Soooo good inverted double kneebar “rest” feels super fun on lead, stern felt so nails and then it just went. Super cool route one of the best ever. · TR. felt pretty good! keep walking feet up, make sure to get the right hands in the correct spot. · Lead / Fell/Hung. classic index beatdown. PR whipper? stem harder. work the layback at top of crack to get to jug. .2 goes in pod below top pod. · TR. belayed by a new friend, michael! got it clean up to the thumb/palm press! need to press on the higher, more positive part. fingerlock in undercling. coming together! · TR. trolo boi stern spanking edition. less fatigue would help... some. still need to understand entrance sequence. got the easier part first try at least!"

The first 50 feet of true start still had not been freed and was one of the most obvious remaining challenges at the Lower Wall.When I got on it for the first time, I couldn’t do all the moves but I could see that it would go, and was surprised that no one had done it yet. The holds and the sequences are quite beautiful...pure Index, but on another level from what I had been on before.It took about a year of getting on it here and there till I saw how it went and could link large sections. After an easy intro, the main part of the climb is only 25 moves, but 25 moves of tricky and hard vertical granite bouldering, with some classic Index funk and consistent bad feet. I linked the crux 3-move boulder for the first time this winter and knew then that it could go at any point.I decided to add 2 bolts to be consistent with how the rest of Ten Percent is bolted, and started to make attempts on lead. After 15 or so attempts over a few months, including a couple falls above the crux, I sent on a cool and dry spring evening, likely one of the last good days before the summer heat.This route could go gear only, but it seemed way more fun to not have to wiggle in stoppers, take massive, awkward, and possibly dangerous falls on them, and then wiggle them out to make another “clean” attempt. Somebody could surely do it...they will be way more badass than me. But now people can go free ground up safely and focus on enjoying the moves on one of Index’s best routes.After a few difficult boulders, the route breaks hard right on a line of crimps with bad feet to the ledge below the low anchors on Japanese Gardens. You could probably go straight up and avoid the ledge, but this seemed contrived. And instead of continuing up the 5.11+ climbing on Ten Percent I decided to end it short. It didn’t seem to fit the nature of the free variation to lengthen the pitch.I’m suggesting another name for the direct free variation, “En Passant,” French for “In Passing,” because it resonates with “Ten Percent,” and because I think the reintegration of the direct start deserves a more interesting name than “10% Direct.” The crux clocks in around V10/11, and you can fall in other places as well. I think it’s a solid step up from Amandla (5.13+) in difficulty and is likely Index’s first 5.14.",

The original aid version of this route had 5 pitches (5.8 A4). The free version really only has 4, as the original second pitch is best combined with p1.P1 (Original): Formerly the last remaining bit of aid on the original TPMV, this section was free climbed recently at 5.14-. See neighboring entry \"10% Direct (En Passant)\". This is also an excellent C1/2 climb and in years past was often used as a place to practice hanging belays and setting up hammocks/portaledges.  For many years there was a two bolt anchor about 40’ up to facilitate aid practice.P1 (Japanese Gardens to TPMV):  This pitch is most often done as a standalone climb by beginning on P1 of Japanese Gardens and then stepping left at the first (short) anchor. The rest of the pitch follows shallow corners and cracks past 3 bolts and gear to another anchor (.11+).P1 (Extended): Climb the Japanese Gardens P1/TPMV linkup as described above but keep continue past the anchor. The section above consists of a difficult height dependent bouldery section protected by good but small gear (.12c-.13a). The gear must be placed well, otherwise the fall onto the P1 anchor is fairly substantial. As such, it is a mandatory strategy if free climbing to climb this as one pitch from the ground. This extension is basically the old \"Chopper Flake\" pitch 2 of TPMV; see \"History\" for more information about the flake.P2: This was actually P3 of the original aid climb. Climb cracks up a RFC to a comfortable ledge.  From there face climbing angles left to an anchor below the obvious corner start of the slab pitch (fun 5.10-, slightly runout).P3: Fantastic, challenging pitch of slab and corner. Traverse left and up from the anchor and do a committing and slightly scary move back right to clip the first bolt. Continue up the difficult corner via bolts and gear, then follow the left-trending dike until you can step right to a ledge with an anchor via runout 5.9 climbing. Alternately, continue up the dike and over the roof to join Newest Industry. This pitch can also be approached via P1-2 of Japanese Gardens and is well worth the trip either way (.11b/c).P4: This pitch climbs a slab past a bolt and some gear to a tough little mantle past a bolt. (5.10d) Cracks then lead near the anchor on top of Newest Industry, but 10% continues on via three slab options: a) climb out right and then up over some overlaps to the anchor (5.8). At one point there was a bolt and a pin on this variation. b) continue straight up past 2 bolts to the anchor. This variation has the best protection (5.9). c) an easier variation with less protection climbs to the left before arching back to the right to the anchor. It should be noted that a fun alternate finish that joins Japanese Gardens can be climbed by following a ramp up and right to join JG on its last pitch (5.11).",

Please Note: there is 3\" ledge just below the first anchor that is possible to tag with a heel or toe if one whips from the crux.  On one of my falls I didn't have quite the clearance, and smashed my heel smack into the small ledge, which didn't feel that awesome after sailing through the air for 15'.  Beware. That said, I didn't use any small cams.  I believe I protected the crux with a micronut.  If you decide to place a cam instead (which will definitely work), there is less room to use the crack pocket for your fingers. Yesterday I was up there and noticed the extension bush and greenery have really grown back.  Fortunately, this area is small.  Perhaps I'll head back up and do some cleaning soon. Also, don't let the grade intimidate.  It was one of those really hard to gauge routes.  While the crux is potent, it is relatively short lived and balancy to boot.  If you're taller than 5'6\" I think that it would be perhaps only 5.12.  Though, the only other ascent was by my buddy Tobias who is 5'4\". Jan 6, 2014",

Terminal Preppie offers multiple 5.11 cruxes with a great blend of power and finesse.Climb easily to the first bolt, then ponder the first crux:  an insecure friction sequence to nab a good jug below the roof.  Undercling right and power over the bolt-protected roof (5.10 if you do it right), then balance up to a short crack/flake.  Place a small wired if you want, or run it out to clip the first bolt of a fantastic three-bolt crimping sequence on matchstick to half-inch edges.  The highly technical ultimate crux comes at the last bolt, starting off a good stance, which is good because it might take awhile to decipher.Ah, but it's not over!  After a moderate runout (good holds will appear), sidle up on a flake below the final roof and place a small wired (good placements).  The final 5.11 crux pulls the roof on thin jams to a bomber rail, with a welcome horizontal hand crack at the back.",

Traversed left to Pisces and finished on GNS. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Haley lead just first pitch. I struggled a lot this time. Need to practice on my wide crack technique. Max pink pointed. Then had some shenanigans getting down. Left a biner at a bolt:( · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Still have issues at the crux similarly to Battered Sandwich. Note to my future self: What worked well was to smear left foot closer to crack, put right foot in where it’s lose and twist/cam it clockwise. I think being more careful with my feet in the crux and inching them up with care of getting a good right foot placement will give me enough reach to finally get a better than rattle fist jam. · Follow. 1st pitch: fist crack 2nd pitch: finger crack 3rd pitch: squeeze chimney 4th pitch: lieback · 4 pitches. Lead. Great route! Pitch 1, used the fist jam and arm bar to overcome the crux Pitch 2’s thin finger is hard. Pitch 3’s flaring buttlip chimney is very hard. Pitch 4 hand traverse and arete is very cool. · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. W Ben. I linked 1+2, he linked 3+4. One-hung the crux on the first wide pitch then hung a few more times on the finger crank up high. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Slipped in chimney. Fun, sustained, and varied climbing. Definitely felt hard for 5.8 · Lead / Fell/Hung. W Ryder. Led 1&2, followed 3&4. Fucking hard. Not 5.8 in my book. Also sweet climbing · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. second pitch placed a .4 in the finger pod needed to pull up...pulled gear · 1 pitch. TR. Did the first pitch before sickle crack. Flared part was hard af and I had to take multiple times before I could make enough progress to get a foot jam in · Follow. Just the first two pitches. Gear anchor at top of first short pitch. Then rappel on tat and piton? for the second pitch. Polished! More like a 5.10, hard ass 5.9! Lauren led first two pitches. One 70 m rope gets you down from second pitch. · 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. P1 only of Aries. Felt great. Then linked with Sickle · 4 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Followed pitches 1-3, led 4 clean In previous weeks, have led pitches 1-3 · 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Did the first 2 pitches, chimney was wet so we traversed to great northern slab. Super chossy · Lead / Onsight. Lead pitch 1 and 3 Butt lips was easier then Stanley but very hard. Wyatt was star struck and met Angela van Miersch, worlds slowest rappel · Sat at the anchor forever with Angela Vanwiemeersch who is fucking cool and watched Wyatt do the slowest belay transition he has ever done hanging with her and an 80 year old man named Tim in a body harness · 4 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Linked pitches 1-2 and 3-4. Led 3rd and 4th, slipped on 3rd pitch. · Lead / Onsight. Odd pitches with Tom and Hayden. Jericho, Mandy, and Isaiah followed. · 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Andrew. I led all the pitches because Andrew couldn’t do the chimney. (we didn’t do the final pitch). Great climb! Felt like solid 10a · 2 pitches. Follow. Andrew led. I tried to lead the chimney but couldn't figure it out. Then Andrew led it first go and showed me how! Felt nice on TR. · 3 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Climbed to anchors on top of 2nd GNS. Led the buttlips, fell a couple times in it · 2 pitches. Lead. Did first 2 pitches to see fixed gear; Chimney pitch looks super cool! W Ceeg · Lead. Climbed with Zach. Made a mess of this one. Zach got a blue totem stuck on P3 aiding the chimney and I lowered back in to try to get unstuck and ended up dropping my phone and nut tool in the process - quite the pricey cam :( Luckily recovered 2/3. The climbing was fun - I enjoyed P2,3 and 4. P3 is pretty stout for 5.8. · Lead / Fell/Hung. led P1, P2, P5. chimney was stout. exposed undercling on P4 also felt hard for grade. first fall on gear on P1! · I lowkey love this route now…first time I did it in 2021ish, I struggled a lot. On the first large hand crack but I made it up! I really enjoy taking the finger crack past the ledge :) · Lead / Fell/Hung. W/ Jon, lead 3/4. Pulled my way thru the chimney, shaking like a little bitch lol · Lead / Onsight. Lead first 4 pitches, charlie lead the last. 3rd pitch I fell a ton lmao · Lead / Onsight. Headlight climbing in the dark was fun. did extra lap on buttlips to get ready for prusik · Lead. Gen linked 1+2, I linked butt lips and next pitch. Could easily have taken it to top · 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Led the first 2 linked. Partner couldn’t get cam out and didn’t like the look of the flare so we bailed after I got it out · Lead / Fell/Hung. Almost cried at the top of p3 after doing it essentially unprotected and thinking I’d deck and end up paralyzed ✨ p2,4,5 were wonderful tho! · 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Rosie led P1, I led P2, Larissa followed. Only climbed 2 pitches · 4 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Linked 1/2 and 3/4, then rapped from top of 4. I led all four pitches, hung a couple times on the chimney. Gotta work on those... · Follow. led p1. had to aid on gear. could not get the technique for this crack. David Tran led p2-p5. the chimney was really hard. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Climbed with Kory who followed. I lead all pitches. Hung on pitch 3. · 2 pitches. Lead. Linked P1 and p2. One take on p2. Friggen great set of pitches. Wanna come back to do the full thing! · Lead / Onsight. W/ Hish, led 2-6, he did 1. Um yea, butt lips is odd. I did left-side in & ended up French-aiding the route. P4 however, gnarly committing layback slab w/ engaging exposure & transition onto the crack system above. Not sure if I’ll do this route again soon, but I am glad to have done it for the mileage. 3.2/5 I’d say I have a 5.10 effort, but there’s likely easier ways of your a traveled chimney, off-width, & laybackinf climber. · Lead / Flash. Led the chimney, few pieces of gear were in already, lead the traverse above to a tree anchor. Linked P1-2, P3-4 · Lead. Today I rescued #3 WC that was left for dead. The poor little guy swore to protect his leader, but was abandoned in the crack where misguided climbers beat him viscously with rocks. :-( . . .That is no way to treat your Friends . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . ..only a little french free to get up the chimney this time. left side in. it's just a couple of difficult moves from the good hand jams and foot nubbin before you reach the jugs. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Onsighted p1, fell p2, pulled on gear p3, followed p4, onsighted p5 with Brendan · 3 pitches. Follow. Tried reminding myself that it was “only 5.8”. Was still very hard. · 3 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Tough climb. First pitch scary fist cracks. Second pitch no good clipping stances. Chimney is no joke no prepared to hurt and sweat. Fourth pitch is dope. (Linked 1&2) · Lead / Fell/Hung. Mistakenly only climbed the first pitch. Don’t do that. Also fell. · 1 pitch. TR. Hard move moving the foot from layback into crack, flailed a ton · Follow. yowza, with Jack. this ain't a 5.8 by any stretch. first pitch is fist and body jamming for life. think best not to link pitches so follower fall line stays at crack (I got tossed far to right with a fall and had to find alt route up). second pitch is a tiny crack crack... with poor / polished feet (better climbers would obv do better). third pitch is a ridic incomplete chimney (more like a corner). I flared outwards as I went so had to take falls and pull gear. fourth pitch is an airy horiz traverse with poor feet again, need to compress against upper back to get purchase). def need radios to comm. ends at 3p anchors for GNS. 5th pitch is top P for GNS. note walk off is (a) rap down GNS, (b) deep gulch via ferrata, or (c) longish walk off through woods (turn left at uphill fork and follow cliff to K. when better climber, this route will be fun. · 4 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Led all pitches. Hung once on the chimney pitch. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Final 5 pitches to complete for 30. this was a great end to the beginning. lead P1, P2, P5, Maciej leading P3, P5 short little climbs for each pitch gave us fun things to try while finishing on Anchors to GNB. great variety, however I would love to do this climb without sweating and slipping with my hand Jams on P1. overall great climb. will revist this one, mark my words. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Not prepared for the difficulties, scrambled around the first pitch, climbed sickle crack for P2, aided P3, and lead P4 & 5 clean · Lead. With Dan. Pulled on gear to finish P1 and hauled self up P3. That chimney is brutal. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led P2 and P3. Hung twice on P3. Zach led P1, P4, P5. P3 beta for next time. Left hand and left foot in the crack, with right foot against the back wall · Max lead 1,3,5. Haley lead 2,4; the money pitches:). We both sucked at the chimney pitch and had to aid up it. Ugh. · Lead. Beth led first 4 pitches, aiding a lot. I led the last happy 5.7 arête slab · Lead / Fell/Hung. Chimney is some BS 5.8+. Need to go back and try it again. Remember it being horrible. Took a whipper at the last pitch at the top because of rope dragging pulling me down the mountain. · Lead / Onsight. Haley and max lead the 1st pitch just because the crack looked so cool. Max had a couple takes at the awkward section. Can’t wait to come back to do all 5 pitches. Bring stuff to build anchors. · 1 pitch. Lead. w/ Genevieve. Linked to GNS. Felt unbalanced getting into the wide crack. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung on the chimney pitch Had many shenanigans happen with Jamie. Will come back to do this cleanly · Lead / Fell/Hung. Did a few laps on P1 and sickle — frying my shoulder on the off width · Follow. Had to prusik up the flared chimney cus I couldn’t figure out the knee bar"

Couldn’t get through the tight hands. Perfect hands right after. · TR. Flashed! Thought this was a 5.8 uponsight. Tight hands. Tall enough to reach past the ring locks. 5.9+. Harder for me than Rattletale · Lead / Onsight. Bottom wasn’t as bad as I was expecting. Pull a couple finger stacks with tight hands, high feet on the offset, then hand jam away. Crux might have been the almost baggy fists through the weird finish. Feels almost identical to Breakfast of Champions. · Follow. took after the finger crack, at the surprisingly tricky hand/fist section. the rest of the route was chill · Lead / Onsight. Super difficult was happy to get the on-site. Perfect hand crack! · TR. Hard start, tight hands .75 gets easier with good hands after a few moves · *almost* feels like 10- if youre tall with small hands. the wide 2s higher was hardest for me · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lol I slipped out cuz it was greasy and i dropped my hat oops Beautiful night out with Jess · Follow. I fell a bunch of times, it was not a super sendy day for me but the route was very fun, kind of hard to get into at first due to the missing block · TR. while rapping from Aries... Even hard on top rope, but did \"TRed point.\" did the crux 3 times, couldn't really find an easier way... I wonder how helpful the pile of loose blocks that used to be next to it were.. · Follow. Attempted lead, but couldn’t quite pull of the move before you entered the hand-width portion of crack. Attempted lie backing the start. You were strong enough to do it, just couldn’t get the transition dialed. After multiple falls, lowered and followed Brandon’s lead. Brandon jammed the entire climb. He got a high left foot jam at the beginning, while working thin hands until crack widened. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at the crux. Spent a bit of time dialing the sequence from the start. Tricky footwork with little options for me (5-8) under the pod. Found the beta though. Happy to actually pull the moves clean even if it took 15 minutes to sequence it lol. Locals claim that the grading on this is inaccurate because the starting blocks have fallen. Who knows. I say 10c. · Lead / Fell/Hung. I made it up it but it wasn’t pretty!! A lot of work to do! · Lead. Traversed over to the perfect splitter at the top of the easy 5.7 to the left — I want to come back and get this proper · Lead / Fell/Hung. needed to get a higher left hand thumbs down jam before leaving the good feet. · Lead / Onsight. Thought this was breakfast of champions because I am not a smart man. Very fun route though. Did feel hard for 10-, but not so bad · Lead. Placed some early pieces, couldn’t get it. Lowered down and eventually got it straight through clean. Rough · TR. Hard. Very hand size dependent and worthy of an Indian Creek style flat grade of 5.10. · Lead. Sweaty hands pulled out and absolutely whipped onto a single purple .5, very scary · TR. Slipped once getting established but then it went. Thin seems leadable once I’m in better shape · TR. mock lead, gear beta: .75 1 2 3 :) bring more 1s and 2s for Pisces after. · TR. followed this pitch after leading the first, only uncomfortable for a short section, very easy to protect · TR. Bottom section is hard. Took once on TR. Was hot and sweaty. Gear: .75-3, heavy on 1-2”. Fairly short crux section. · Lead / Redpoint. didn't get shredded. the first of many \"hard cracks\" done by the Scout-sized hands. slightly tight to big · Lead / Fell/Hung. with lauren. I think with a better head I could lead this clean. · TR. Fell once on the start then got it the second go. Start is thin hands 0.5/0.75 and slightly overhanging, very difficult but widens quickly. (HS) · 3 pitches. TR. 3 laps clean. 1st no gear, 2nd placed gear and left it, 3rd cleaned gear while climbing. 2x 0.75 from ground, reach up above both, left foot jam under roof, layback R hand, bump left hand, right foot layback crack edge, repeat. 1,1,2,2,3 w/ draw · TR. Pulled on gear for the start.... oooof, not good at thin hands. Great hands and fists after · TR. lowered again from P2 GNS, another clean send plus Picses. Same beta, stem, high gear, reach 2x thin hands, kinda layback left and get a foot high, step up to good hand! Don't blow the funky exit. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung after getting up to a decent #1 jam. Felt sort of close to doing this clean. · Lead / Fell/Hung. hung for some reason instead of downclimbing to ledge, clean from the ledge · 3 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Hard linked with very thin Corner crack off the ground · Lead / Fell/Hung. RATTLEY THIN HANDS - Done after sandy corner, crux was getting past first part of the crack, also slightly steep.

To climb the crack w/o climbing Libra there is now only a single commonly climbed option:Climb the 5.0 gully past the giant rings and follow the corner (part of GNS) before traversing right to the base of the 5.6 hand crack. The crack starts just above Libra Crack. It is important to note that the Index Town Walls guide book by Kalman and Van Biene include Libra crack (5.10a) as part of the original Pisces route and therefore rates Pisces a 5.10a.It used to be possible to climb the 5.4 corner above, and just left, of Blockbuster before traversing left past an arete to the base of the crack. However the blockbuster boulder was pushed off the wall with a hydraulic jack presumably for safety reasons. The remaining wall is no longer commonly climbed and the Blockbuster route is gone forever.",

Great route! A little trick, great position, good stone. Well bolted · Lead. Started on the climb to the right and crossed over to the face. Doable with an alpine · Lead / Flash. Spooked but really good holds on everything. Way too skidish the first time for how easy this climb was. Can definitely lead it first next. · Lead / Onsight.

Awkward cleaning. · Lead / Onsight. 5 stars! So cool varied styles and slopes! Rad jams and jugs and crimps and slab. Good exposure. Rad! Gunned for Nastassia · Lead / Flash. Fun route. Crux right before anchor moving over exposed arete on right · TR. So fun! But dirty at the top though! Anchors aren’t great for TR but it’s sufficient. Shares an anchor with the Arete climb next to it · Lead / Fell/Hung. Onsight except for one take a few moves from the finish · Lead / Onsight. Lovely hand crack and fist crack. Climbing with Ri. Lots of exposure. Beautiful views · Lead / Flash. Fun engaging climbing with lots of variety! Moves up and over the roof were my crux. Careful what you grab here with some loose blocks. · TR. W/ Quena. Very 3D climbing, some handjams up an overhung crack was a first for me. · Lead. Super fun 5.8. Great movement and holds. Final move to pull onto the anchor ledge could be harder for shorter climbers; I used a pretty wide compression to get over. · Lead / Onsight. Seems like bolts are off and we went to intermediate anchors of the 5.7 next to it. ~10 bolts and I would guess longer than 75 feet listed. Moves above the anchors in the picture were the crux but overall not the craziest sandbag in the world. Probably fave 5.8 I’ve done. · Lead. Psa, watch your head when you pass the bush that’s halfway up the climb. Otherwise you might get a face-full of dried plant bits… · Lead / Redpoint. I think I've been on this route before. Pretty good route. · TR. Fell twice. Turns out climbing a 5.8 in sandals on a 90 degree day is not the move · Lead. quite a bit harder than the other 2 - very fun as well · Lead / Onsight. First onsight of the year! Fun and a little spooky. I have no shame in admitting that I grabbed the stump, it came in handy! All’s fair outdoors! · TR. Love it. Exposure, good views. Hard moves towards the end. Chimneys. Stemming! Project lead for someday… · Lead / Onsight. VERY fun, felt quite exposed for the last 3 moves but Kat was waiting at the top and encouraging me · TR. Stay to the right of the tree for an easy lead then lower on the left for a fun challenging toprope. · Lead / Onsight. Interesting and fun. Take stiff draw for a few reachy clips. · TR. TR, no falls. Fantastic climb. Good crimps on the face into a very steep section with jugs and jams. If I’m ever back I should lead this Probably got sunburned climbing this. Climbed with Azeem."

More draws for the second pitch than I thought. Turned it into 3 pitches · Lead / Fell/Hung. First pitch Kayla led, second pitch Jeannie led fell at last bolt due to flake breaking off. Leave draws in due to route taking such a big turn. Kayla fell on top and swung way left of route and way off route. Sketchy sketchy. First multi pitch tho! · Lead. Led first pitch-really fun! Hayden led 2nd. 2nd felt tough and reachy for short people · Lead / Onsight. Pulled a head sized block off the second pitch. Take care · Follow. Followed Ben, fell twice and used a hangar for a foot through the crux · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung at 4th or 5th bolt of the second pitch. First pitch was pretty easy maybe 5.7 or 5.8, just follow the bolts through the easiest terrain. · Lead / Fell/Hung. w/ Allison. Fun! She was scared and didn't want to second P2 which scared me and involved lots of shenanigans and a moment of weakness take halfway up P2. But really enjoyed, would climb again. · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. First pitch. excellent view from the belay station of pitch 2 · Lead. Confusing route. 1st pitch wanders right, 8 bolts. 2nd pitch feels significantly harder than a 10b- moves back and forth. Didn’t realize that you passed a set of anchors so stopped at them. · Lead / Onsight. Led p1 clean follow p2 until hold broke right before anchors · Lead / Onsight. This route is fun!

Surprised more people aren't on these accessible sport moderates. Seems like there are a lot more routes/projects on the wall than what are on MP, would love to know more details! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Stopped at the anchor in the right a couple bolts below the top of the second pitch due to timing. Fun route, but the first pitch was a bit complicated to route find due to the cluster of bolting going on around that area (Multiple sets of anchors everywhere you look and different bolt lines basically on top of each other.) don't get drawn right until you reach the massive tree root, the line is basically straight up until that."

Upper section takes a little more commitment but is much easier dry! 5 bolts (one extended with double) and single rack to 2. Liked the black totem and 0.75 at the end! · Lead / Onsight. cleaned up nicely. the dihedral is fun and well protected. this thing eats ropes when you pull them. · Lead / Onsight. super fun, easy climbing. the chimney is a bit harder, but still not too hard and with good pro, it has bolts. I used a golden nut, a .4, a .75, a .5, and could've placed another .3 or .4 at the top of the chimney · Lead / Fell/Hung. One hang at 2nd corner where it got pretty wet. Awesome route! · Lead / Fell/Hung. thought i was gonna die. thought i was gonna quit climbing. but we’re here. · TR. Clean. Would be great option to lead as one of first Trad leads before season is out. · Lead / Flash. Haley and max lead. Very fun and some great movement. I used .3-1. Bring lots of alpine draws · Follow. Sam lead, varied climbing with blocks and dihedrals, mostly easier climbing, the dihedral at the end is sporty but the holds are all there · Lead / Onsight. Fun, extremely slimy before second set of bolts (May 22). Stiff for an 8 but stem stem stem and it goes. · Lead / Flash. with matthew an mike. lots of fun. take it slow and dont be afraid to throw a foot behind you at the crux · Lead. Dirty down low, but fun climb and spicy stem/chimney moves to finish it out! · TR. Tr was up so may as well, lucky it was cause it was seeping and slick at the top. Fun route · Lead / Onsight. Wet and covered in slime. Woulda been an awesome route otherwise. Stoked on the lead. · Lead. Wet cracks made the upper crux a little slippery, but definitely worth climbing again. Finish with a 0.75 then 2. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took coming to top of second dihedral. Fully stretched out and still had to swing · Lead / Onsight. Surprisingly fun! Last bolt flexed when pulled but can protect before and after! · Lead / Onsight. Max and Haley lead. Super fun and amazing views at the top! · Lead / Onsight. Single rapped off to bring G + Jordan up. Go outside first flake. Stem dihedral, don't go left. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at Chimney. Steady dripping waterfall led to the wall being algae filled, one take and I worked around lower chimney on face climb and stepped back in midway up. · TR. Wet up top- ended up using chimney technique but awkward to top out- PG finished. 0.4 for top. · Lead / Onsight. Easy at bottom but dirty...exciting and fun for the grade when exiting the chimney at top · Top roped this long, fun, straightforward route which gets progressively more difficult towards the top ending in a great stemming corner for the final moves to the anchors. Probably the most sustained route I've climbed to date. 3 bolts and a fat rap rin"

Running out of juice for crux section, had to treat with hanging draw and stepping on the bolt to get over it. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Had a fall on the traverse trying to gaston on the left · Lead / Redpoint. Clipping beta for the 5th bolt (mid crux) made this possible: high opposing smearing feet and a low right crimpy sidepull allowed me to (barely) clip the draw and keep it moving. Happy to start breaking into 5.11 at this crag :) · Lead / Onsight. Can place a .2 or .3 in flake between the more spaced out bolt 5 to 6 · TR. Pretty sure I’ve climbed this before. Sustained slab and crimps. Would not lead. · TR. Fell at crux. Keep feet centered and match hands on middle crimp before bumping left foot to rail and left hand to pocket. So fun! Will be back. · Lead / Fell/Hung. After the third bolt step down and math rail, left foot out, then get the slot · Lead / Fell/Hung. Did first 4 bolts of this climb thinking it was the 5.8 next door…. So hard · TR. 90* out, overheating for top 1/3 of route. For crux, I think what worked best for me is climb up a bit higher on little crimps & smears, before traversing and throwing left hand to the crack. Haven’t found good clipping stance for the clip right before the flake (clip #6?) · TR. Middle section has a lot of tenuous holds that felt hard on my fingers, need to build up some strength so I’m not full crimping to pieces. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard figuring out the Gaston move and then struggle bus thru the upper crux. Didn’t quite pull the move. Wild, never climbed hard slab before and trusting the feet is hard. Wouldn’t want to fall on the layback flake cos it’s a bit runout to the next bolt · TR. Lead next time. Crux for me was transitioning from the good stance to the 'slot'. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Max lead this as first pitch of the 3 pitch climb. By accident. But he almost flashed it. Had one take on last 1/3 of the climb. Haley TRd. This climb shares the first two bolts with 3 pitch climb and then goes left. 5.9 route go right. · Lead / Fell/Hung. W/ Kyle. Not too much of a struggle need to go back for rp · Lead / Redpoint. fell a bunch trying to traverse left between bolt 3 & 4, first 11 outdoors · Lead / Fell/Hung.

I lead P1 and P3, Matt lead P2 and we were pretty done after just having finished walking legend so we rapped after P3. Per Matt it gets substantially harder and less fun P4-P5 · 3 pitches. Lead. Went up three pitches. Lead on the second. Followed on one and three. Didn’t feel like finishing the route today after doing walking legend too. Found a crow-bar sticking into the pine needles above the 2nd pitch anchor. Couldn’t tell if it was intentionally left there, or lawn darted from up higher, so I brought it down to the ground rather than risk it falling once the rains start. I assume it’s Marty’s. Hope he isn’t missing it being up higher. Left it leaning on a log down on the ground. · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Only pitch 1. A fun move getting to bolt 3. Pro is weak bw bolt 3 and 4 - assess your holds · 1 pitch. Lead / Flash. Only Pitch 1. Crux after 2nd bolt. Go right to get to third bolt. · Lead / Onsight. Went well. Followed on pitch one and two since they were easier then led the final three. Pitch two to four seemed reasonably easy for the grade but the 5th pitch made up for it by being a quite stiff 10 compared to others on the lump, better beta may improve that."

I was pulling the last hard move before clipping the 10th bolt (if my memory serves me correctly) when a key hold blew. I think that normally a fall from that point would be clean, but because it was a hold blowing I was spun sideways in the air before hitting the wall 25+ feet below. I'm pretty sure the climbing just below this point is fairly easy so there is a longer space between these bolts then most bolts on the route.Perhaps 15 feet or so. Once you pass the easier climbing you have to pull one more tough move before clipping the bolt. A fall from here while clean, will probably send someone for quite a ride. As I learned the hard way. There's nowhere to put natural protection in at that point. I'm not sure if this changes the grade of the climb or not, as I was simply climbing the most obvious line and the funnest looking move. Although I am fairly certain that this section is probably more difficult now. Either that or there's a nice incut now. The place where the hold came off is visible in the photo taken from the top of the 3rd pitch. Climbers right of the bush. Probably wouldn't hurt for someone to head up and assess the pitch at some point. I'd be happy to do it but unfortunately I'm going to be outta commission for quite a while now.

Did it in one epic pitch! 80m rope and I think 25 draws. extended everything on p1 and a few bolts on p2. no rope drag, but that much rope is quite heavy towards the top! · Lead / Onsight. On sited all of it except on fall at the final crux of the third pitch. Amazing climb. · Follow. P1 and P2 complete, started P3 and slipped, rope stretched from Joey belaying and hit my ankle on the fall on the only major ledge at the start of P3, unfortunate. Sick route, awesome · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. with Jay. hung at pitch 2 crux. rapped from 2nd pitch since dog appeared missing · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell once on the third pitch second bolt crux but I missed the easier beta out left. Great, fun climb. With Tyler S. and Bret. · Lead / Onsight. Designed by the gods, every hold right where you want it. So good. Lead p2, follow p1 & p3 · Lead / Onsight. Led p1 and followed clean on p2, p3 Thanks Karl for the rope gun · Lead. Top roped finger my slot and the last pitch and lead the second without falling. My second multipitch. With Reese and Thomas · Lead / Fell/Hung. lead p1, followed p2, lead half of p3 but couldn't finish. Harold finished and I followed to the top. hot, 85 degrees · 1 pitch. Just did the first pitch, super fun, want to come back and do the whole thing · Lead / Redpoint. Lead P1, first slab lead in a while, had to gather some courage. follow p2 & p3 clean. a few good totems minimize runouts, single rack black-orange party of 3, lowered both from top to ground with an 80 then 2 raps myself"

TR bottom half, offwidth is still scary! Top was the same as mean mug. · TR. Joe Lead it. I climbed the crack so differently than him… I pressed my back on left side. And did a lot more lay back moves cause the feet on right side was slippery. · TR. I moved anchor from Smiley Kylee to Banana Hammock while cleaning. Was lowered from top of Smiley to ledge at end of Banana. Set up anchor, PA in, went off belay and then pulled rope from Smiley and tossed ends to ground from Banana anchor. · Lead / Redpoint. I did it cleanly! Didn't do any hand stacks this time. Just better footwork and mostly hand jams. · TR. Mock lead this bb. First fist jams ever let’s gooo. They felt way better than the hand jams so I have work to do. · Lead / Flash. First 5.9 on gear (felt a lil soft though)!! Super fun climbing from bottom to top. W/ Sandro on belay! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Still not great at crack, and the offwidth section shut me down several times, even on the pink. Can imagine placing gear in that. Top is super fun with some nice almost vertical face climbing on great crimp-jugs. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard! Thank goodness Luis left some gear up for us to clip into. Crack is off width and moves are pumpy in lower portion of climb. Top portion was airy and flowy. I got in my head about placing tiny gear under flakes. · Lead / Redpoint. Led this route with a 3.5, 4, 1, and 3. 3.5 worked great down low A 5 might be ideal for the lower wide part vs a 4 A 2 might be better than a 1. Wasn’t super happy about the 1 placement. Or a .4 in the finger slot. 3 is best if set deep in the left crack. Extended all pieces Nothing walked on the lower off. · TR. TR’s cleanly. There’s actually great hand-jams most of the way!! No off-width technique required! Just some big throws to reach the next jam sometimes. I could probably lead this… with a few takes, I imagine. · TR. Fun crack with solid jams. Observed a flaring nature to some of the larger cracks above. Some small pro opportunities. · Follow. Follow Deanna. Dry, but dirty. #4-6 all useful, 6 best in top half of ow. Full no hands rest right knee jam. · Lead / Redpoint. Ow gear 3 2 4 5 6 but could skip the 5 and just do 4 & 6 or 5 &6. Mid tat rap anchor gone, now 2 bolts w rings on face to the left (not clipable) so threaded a pinch w double sling. 0.2 & 0.1/0.2 Offset above ledge then yel alien & 0.3. Higher up lots of horizontals 0.4-1, used red tricam. After bolt 0.2-0.3 and purp offset nut before runout. · TR. Mock lead in the pouring rain, took several rests but got through the crux · Lead. Woot!! Took two BD 5s and used both of them (didn't use a #4)!!! · Lead / Onsight. Didnt know crux was low. I scared myself but, it was a fun onsite tho and just beautiful route. go past the first set of anchors for fun adventure, use anchor right of the tree at the top · Lead / Onsight. Exposed after the ledge and a bit scary. First crack was pretty simple and well protected · TR. Mock lead. Lots of small cams on second half. Used z4s in horizontal and shallow cracks up top so save them. Used .1 and .2 cams as well. · Lead / Onsight. fun and varied. diagonal crack was good and top slabby section was airy and delicate but easy · Lead / Fell/Hung. first offwidth. did some fancy stacks and stemming and fell off a couple times getting into the wide bit · TR. Hard start, need to foot jam and hand jam at the top of the crack · TR. clean. Nice climb with varieties. OW section can hand jam. Overhang left nice jug. Rest easy and fun! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Maybe just me but the crack was amazing! kicked my ass but so fun. First climb where I hung on gear... · Follow. Shoved my body in the crack and learned to be calm on slab · Super fun 1st pitch. Did second pitch but it was dirty with sketchy gear on ez climbing · Lead. Felt pretty cruiser! Doubles to 0.5 and singles above to 4. Nice to have a double runner to extend at the intermediate rap rings. · Lead / Flash. Fun trad lead! Good jams for first half and good slab mini jugs up top · Lead / Onsight. Haley and max lead. Heather and Jeremiah trd. Crux towards the top 1/3 of R angled crack. Upper section, straight forward slab. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fun route that has a little bit of everything! Offwidth, fist and hand jams, finger jams, and slab. Really fun climb; definitely used my C3s · Lead / Fell/Hung. Burly crack start. Do it better without shoulder injury. Top takes 0.1 to protect the crux above the bolt. Bring a ton of draws. · Lead / Onsight. didn't go all the way to the anchor, used rap rings above the crux · TR. took a bunch on the first half. learning crack. hard but fun. need to get better and try again · Lead / Fell/Hung. First trad whip (finally)! Great gear through crux, but moves felt a bit insecure even on TR · Lead / Flash. think carefully about extending pieces, it's easy to get tons of rope drag. don't need a #4/5 but having one or the other could be nice"

Three bolts before the anchor are the trickiest. The traverse left was technical crux, physical crux was the diagonal ramp after it · 1 pitch. Lead. No stick clip - grabbed second draw. Otherwise sent everything above bolt 2. Very difficult. Put in some pieces in diagonal rail, which I found as a crux for me as I was on it with my hands. Viper stood up on the rail - there were great knob crimps for this had I looked around. Thought for sure I was going to whip at the top but somehow pulled through it. Intense. · 1 pitch. Led the first pitch 10c cleanly. Had tried this by accident at one point several years ago · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Took over the lead for a buddy so only really led the last few moves of the crux thru to the first chains. · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. First 10c pitch only (to first mussies because chasing shade). Fun! Used a 0.3 and green alien. Could use a 0.4 higher to protect between green alien and anchor. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Cruiser to the crux. Stem out wide to get access to better fingers in the slanting crack. Used a .3, green alien, and .4 · Lead / Flash. With woody he hung the draws Sunny and dry and cool Amazing conditions I wish index was always like this · TR. crux sequence: left hand pinch, right crimp, long reach to left crimp. right foot smear; left foot back step. · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Pretty sweet climb, goes right of the amazing looking dihedral, the top of the climb was the most fun part. · 1 pitch. TR. Pitch 1 is a lot of fun. I'm sure the rest is really good too. I'll have to come back to climb the rest of the route. · 1 pitch. Went to second anchor. Fell 3 times. Need slings. At top of diagonal crack, jog back left. 6 bolts after 1st anchor. Crux = shallow chimney (put feet on right side, and then high R foot/pistol squat) · 2 pitches. TR. long TR. 10c crux is interesting and mantle was pretty easy for me but top crux is weird and really abrasive · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. lead to p2 linked fell at crux of p2. need 16 qd s including anchor. placed .5 at p1 and then .75 on p2 · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Could not get past crux of P1 Brad got a little further then took a big fall Vadim completed · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Tricky traverse crux. Second crux is stepping out of the crack to finish the climb. · Lead. Did P1-3 with an 80. Be careful of drag. 8 bolts on P1 · Lead / Flash. Did first pitch only. Fantastic climb! With rich and Carson and Travis · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead P1, hung once at last bolt before rail traverse cuz I wussed out. Also started the bottom up ramp to left instead of scary arete. Felt great, nailed the undercling traverse. Tots blk to red -purp + 0.3&0.4 z4, brought 0.2 and 2x0.5 too! Follow robby p2&3 clean! Traverse to RTL P4 start from top, kind of a lower out... not horribly sketch. · Lead / Onsight. use long woody for roof, then .75 in crack on left. Awesome line! · Lead. Just the first pitch, really fun but forgot the cams so scary runout to the mussys · 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. very cool movement on p2. well-protected...bolts are right where you want them. I used both of my stiff draws to clip from good stances. · Lead / Onsight. Led the first pitch without gear. Huge scary run out to mussys. Would be really fun with gear for top · Lead / Fell/Hung. Jai led P1, 0.2-0.75 cams for traverse, sketch run out slab fall potential, 1 fall me. skip mussies and go to anchors up and right. I led p2 awesome mantles & heel hooks, 1 fall at crux. p3 clean green & black tot, Rad position but still pretty dirty! · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. lead pitches one, fall at crux, went from last bolt to anchors on the right with no pro bring a .4 and 1 next time · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. First pitch only. Didn't know there weren't bolts at top so had to clip into bolt on other route · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got p1/p2 clean, fell once on p3 trying to be cute in the corner.

After pulling over the little rooflet in the middle of the route, stay left and your next bolt will appear after the dark, left-facing flake.  From here, stay left for your next bolt (the bolt you see to your right is on Smilodon) and a few more fun moves that will take you to the Smilodon anchor without clipping any of that routes bolts. Since these two routes share a 3-bolt anchor, please be mindful of how you arrange your anchor so as to leave space for climbers to lead or TR both lines simultaneously.  If people are finding this shared station to be a hazard or a hassle,  we may revisit the anchor bolt arrangement in the future.  Establishing an independent anchor on the left for Anthropocene could put the rappel line in the territory of the massive detached flakes, which is why it is where it is now. Also, a quick note regarding the grade: depending on how short or tall you are and whether you stay to the right or left the bolt line at the cruxes,  the route can feel anywhere from 5.8+ to .10a.  Choose your own adventure.  The bolts are placed with the intent to make this an interesting and safe climb (ie-- to avoid ledge falls and discourage folks from using the mossy, semi-detached blocks on the left), so feel free to try hard if this grade range is at your limit or enjoy it as warm-up approach pitch of Argentinosaurus.

Ashley, Kai and Sophie climbed the TR that was in place from climbing the route to the right that shared the same anchors. I pulled the rope to lead it. · Lead / Onsight. Super wet. Kind of climbed around the cruxes to stay dry. Probably should try it again later. · TR. Was very very wet earlier today. Went left instead of up face towards the top · Lead / Onsight. Really fun climb to lead. Definitely a bit more difficult but when the going got tough I just cheated a little bit using bushes or bolts as holds. · TR. Made it 7 bolts on lead and bailed at crux (Steve belay). TR’d after (Evan M belay). · Lead / Flash. Really enjoyed it! A few tough clips but more fear than skill difficulty. Perma-draws at the top · Lead / Onsight. w/ patrick and megan. also a great time! almost *too* many bolts in the crux section lol · TR. started raining so just TR. fun! need to get back and lead it when dry · Lead. Great route for the whole family. Last route of our road trip. Jane made it all the way to the top. · Lead / Onsight. Felt a lot easier than the Sabortooth route next door but I think I cheated on the “crux” putting left foot on a block which is left of bolts 4-6. But even apart from that it’s less sustained climbing than Sabortooth which I think is a better route. · Lead / Flash. Second one we did on Friday. Went out left to the block which I think wasn’t the intended route so it felt easier than the one to the right. Good one though! · TR. set it for toprope from the 5.8+ for myself. thought it was easier than the 5.8+, very chill · Lead / Redpoint. Far left beta midway feels wrong but straight up feels hard for 5.9 · Lead / Onsight. Fun! Went a bit too left at one point. TR again in light rain"

Although it was listed in the early Clint Cummins guide, it was labeled as the wrong climb.  The later Cramer guide showed the correct, but otherwise forgotten line.  The most recent Kalman/VanBiene guide appropriately ignored the line.  As of 2019, there was a scary anchor and plenty of tat to mark the path of terror one would follow to complete the line. During the winter of 2019, Gabe Webster and I tried to resurrect the line “Congolindination”.  In the process of removing loose rock, we pretty much removed most of the first half of the climb.  We abandoned the efforts for a few months.  We later determined that “Smilodon fatalis” was a worthwhile climb that actually traversed into the base of the meat of “Congolindination”.  Unfortunately, the upper section of Congo’ moved back into loose and scary rock.  After some deliberation, it was determined that if the route merged with Racer X near the top of both routes, the best climbing from the original route could be had, while giving modern climbers the best possible finish. Cheers to Dave Anderson and Bruce Carson for their vision of the original route and Cheers to the modern climbers who get to enjoy what is offered today. Aug 24, 2020",

        "route_tick_comments": "· Follow. Couldn’t really do the laybacking move. Traversing to the left afterwards was also hard. · TR. Got all of the moves with a fall in the middle, the crux is tough but doable · TR. Fell/hung around the third bolt (but on TR cause it was pretty damp out and scary) This climb will haunt me for as long as the giant bruise now forming on my leg from where I slipped and hit the bolt takes to heal. But actually pretty cool climb and would definitely do another lap then go for the lead. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Couldn’t get the third clip. Had a stick clip handed to me. 10 or so attempts to get it. · Lead / Onsight. I placed 1 .4 cam after the third bolt but it didn't feel necessary · 2nd go. First go had a couple foot slips at 3rd bolt...blaming the heat. Sent after w some sloppy climbing. Fun tricky slab moves on a sweet feature! Like dancing! · TR. Kai led it, hanging several times trying to figure out the moves. I was able to top rope it hanging a couple times before I fully committed to the slabby lie back on the off set feature on the right. Felt like it was the hardest .10d I’ve been on. Audrey managed to pull her way up; she hung a lot before figuring out how to move up through the crux. Kai TR’d it without falling to clean it. Clean and hard moves through the three bolts. · TR. Fall at top of hard section (right) - two attempts. Got high on right arete/rail and then dyno to left hand crimp. Should look for different beta. · Lead / Redpoint. Get feet as high as possible. LH to crimp, adjust feet (left on small hold), RH good edge, LH finger jam. · Lead. One fall in crux because no friction (hot and muggy). Immediately got back on and finished it · Lead / Fell/Hung. Clean to the second half of the layback. Then I couldn’t make the layback go at all. I couldn’t get my feet to stick. · TR. Wow super committing smear to bolt 3. Took me a few attempts to dial in. Had to find left foot on small nub to desperately move over to presumed clipping position. · Lead / Fell/Hung. With Claire, figured out the method for the crux; feet right of the arete · TR. work up arete with wide pinches (using small features for thumbs). press hard with both feet on face. keep feet high. key is getting good pinches. step left AFTER getting left hand on one of the crimps (can go for either the small, lower crimp or the bigger edge). decent finger jam to clip off of. · TR. Lots of falls on the damp rock. Coming back to it! Needs to be dry to get the feet high lol · TR. Next time, go left after first left foot at upper crux. And use shoes with more grippy rubber, not resoled TC pros · Lead / Fell/Hung. No trad. Almost got it first try and then took awhile · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell once in crux unfortunately, but linked into pitch two for an awesome 40 m pitch · Lead / Fell/Hung. Greased off the thin layback just before the jug. Lay it back to the top then go left to the good hold. .75 · TR. took once at upper crux. Lower crux, stand on the triangle. Face right arete foot hold. Squeeze. Slab. Crux 2: right hand jug, up two steps. Then right hand sidepull, foot close to body. Good hand on the left. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 fall, 1 take — same place. Thought I was gonna get it first go! Really cool tricky feet, laybacking on smears is a wild time. Went dynamic at the crux, but worked it on TR on the way down and it goes way easier just trusting feet. Oh yeah, .5 and .4 for the top. Probably could just do one or the other. · TR. Hard one!! Zack was giving some beta as I tried the smear move. Semi figured it out but it was definitely anti style! · TR. Tough crux sections. Fell 2-3 times at the second one but got it. Tough. · Follow. Omfg the feet were so mossy for such an insecure and powerful lie back. Classic index right here. · Lead / Onsight. I never did the left “v4”, instead of following chalk I climbed on some nubs left then a pretty big runout to chains. · TR. Stay a little left on the first bolt, second to third bolt…don’t know yet. · TR. Tricky and still need to put it together. Beta for lower layback. Right shoulder in left hand on side crimp, left foot on smear on arete, right hand on arete, right foot on small foothold in corner. Smear and lift up on left foot and get the rail. Second layback is powerful but out you get jug on left it’s cruiser. Question is how to get there. · Lead / Fell/Hung. beta: use left pinch and black crystal to stand to L crimp · TR. Move feet to face once layback changes angle. Left foot to chip, reach left to crimp. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell a bunch of times, good thing this route is so well protected! The lower section is tough, but if you get the sequence right (left crimp/ right crimp to right side pull to left crimp to ledge mantle) it’s short. The upper sequence is much harder — right juggy side pull with feet on the right, move feet to the left just after the bend, keep pulling with tiny foot progression until you can grab the left jug. Fell A LOT of times to figure this out. Bring some hand sizes for the final section. · Follow. took a few falls on crux. hard lie back. #3 placement up top"

Fell off dirty hold pulling off of ramp and once again at roof. Led again w/ headlamp and firework ambiance. W/ Emma · Lead / Fell/Hung. can start right of 36v with a purple or green cam. finger size cams at top, or can go left to 36v anchor · 1 pitch. TR. Such a fun romp. I’ve climbed this several times. I am always stumped by the roof. Left foot edge press, right foot toe jam in the top of the roof. Great climb for remembering feet always win over hands! · TR. The traverse right is tough! I didn’t see any feet so I just campused it. The next part is really tough and burly. Well protected by bolts if I were to lead it (though it took a green alien at the top of the crux). Would be a tough lead for me right now — really struggled (fell 4 times) on the crux. · 1 pitch. TR. Cheat start out left of first 2 bolts, couldn't get through roof crux cuz my skin was destroyed and rock is really high friction. cool route tho, end at mussies to left after crux · 1 pitch.

Good L hand, R hand up. Shitty L foot, left side pull in crack, right foot under bolt, shift hands, stretch for top · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell trying to stay right at start. Rest clean. · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. A big ass rock came off in my hand while pulling the roof. Managed to hold onto it and throw it safely away without killing Emily.

Well protected steep slab pulling over a small bulge, decent hand holds with mainly friction smears for feet. Another micro crux just below the anchor moving left into a sloping crack. Very fun line! · Lead / Onsight. Did hedge trimmer and linked it to the second half of flying salamander. · Lead / Onsight. Super fun route with an intriguing finish! Would def return for another lap · Lead / Fell/Hung. I continued the lead from the ground. Indeed 15 draws. Crux at the 3rd bolt above the midway anchor, I had to pull on the draw a lot to get through. Also hard between the last bolt & anchor, I went far left off-route to get a crack with good finger-locks to finish those last few feet. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Nearly a (slow) “flash” but I couldn’t figure out the top on the first try. Beta: LH sidepull on nub, throw for RH jam, feet on small obvious ledge and muscle up to pull jugs · TR. Top rope 1st try w rappel 70m rope - sick route and first 10a at index · Lead / Onsight. Really fun!! Did this one third of the day, loooved the slab up top · Lead.

Gotta redo this one was really fun! · Lead / Flash. really fun, technically did a pink point but it was first try · Lead / Fell/Hung. Did two laps, hung on the first lap. On the second lap I fell on the last sequence of moves above the final draw due to a foot slip. · Lead / Redpoint. Super stoked to get on this and send it clean again. Such a fun little slabby techy route! · Lead / Onsight. Easy first half. Much trickier second half. Two cruxes that require some thought and searching for hands/feet. Sidepulls before the anchors were slimy… · TR. Fun but once you suss it out it’s good. The smear on third bolt of upper section is the tricky bit · TR. Follow Mantas.

I had to pull up my rope and send my belayer back behind a tree to do it safely. This is too much of a starter climb to have such a big block coming down by surprise. It was right where you would pull to grab the anchor hooks. Route seems clean now. No change to grade and the anchor ledge has more room now. The rock clipped the top bolt before the anchors and bent the hanger a bit but the bolt still seems solid and functional. https://youtube.com/shorts/vH-4SkUuYMo · Lead / Onsight. Stayed a bit right of bolt line where the chalk was, very mellow lead on that side. · TR. Top rope after leading and setting up, stayed direct on the bolt line and it was more fun and a little stiffer. Great climb either way. Super well bolted · TR set by Sarah, fun send.

Had no problems on TR but didn’t lead. Do it next time. Very fun · Lead / Onsight. Tried to do war on Doug’s but it was soaked in algae, this one was fun and probably better · Lead / Redpoint. draws only. fell at 2nd bolt. roof is fun and well protected. · Lead / Onsight. w/ patrick and megan. i thought the hardest part was pulling off the ground! roof moves were sweet - great feet and hands. clipped the chains off of a horrible crimp but there’s a good sidepull i missed. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fun and we’ll protected but super hard finish! Like a V3 boulder problem. Funky start too · Lead. Fell trying to get over lip a few times. Very fun route though · TR. no falls until the overhung crux, tried it a few times before finally getting it. I was concerned I wasn't going to finish it! · TR. High point is the jug at crux. Couldn’t match. Best shot is first climb in flash. Fresh. · TR. 3 falls in the roof. Very cool route. Will Be back when the ankle clears up · Lead / Fell/Hung. This felt a lot harder than cunning stunt. 2 move wonder. Maybe come back and try this again in a few months. · Lead / Onsight. God damn shit. OS but felt hard. The upper parts of the routes looked dirty AF. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell a few times on the roof. MAYBE possible to Redpoint but would be limited most likely by power · TR. Got the tronsight!!! Burly finish, but super secure. Interesting moves at the bottom too! I think I could lead it next time. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got the start but whipped at the second to last bolt · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. harder than 10b in my opinion, crux at the start, 1st bolt have to be tall enough to reach when close ground, can't clip when making the moves. roof the second crux, left hand up when going over lip · Lead / Flash. Watching someone else climb first really helped. Sweet climb, somehow has a variety of moves packed into a short distance!

Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead on pitch 1 and 2. We both tried the roof and couldn’t make our way up on the right of the bolts so we went left of them. I couldn’t commit to the one sloper grip “step up” so I bailed right to the other chains. retrieved all the gear. Will try again. · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Lead the first pitch and bailed because it was super wet · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led the second half. Took bc there were anchors next to me and bolts above me and wanted to make sure I was going the right way. This is not a trad climb. There are so many bolts. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell near the top of P3 on some funky face climbing moves. Started on Flying Salamanders and linked into the Rope Eating Mice pitch to bypass a party on Behind the Tombstone. · 3 pitches. Follow. With Andrew, started on Flying Salamanders into top of P2 to pass a party of 3. I led pitch 4, super fun! · Lead / Redpoint. Fell on the 3rd pitch first go, got it red point on the second. Beta is undercling and kneebar NOT kicking out blindly · Lead / Onsight. led 1 and 3 with Grant. short pitches, but still very fun · Lead / Onsight. Led odds, Emmett and I both led the last one. Wild stuff on p3, though all the pitches were good. Great route · Lead / Fell/Hung. w/ Karthik, led p2 and 4. Took on reachy slab p2 and fell at crux p3.

Led 1st and 3rd pitches. Took a hang on pitch 3 before the high step side pull. · Lead. P1-3, lead pitch 1. pitch 3 is wild, felt hard for the grade. wicked exposed move to 'ride the lightning', after that, there's 2 very close bolt lines up the face, we took left but right looked possibly easier? P4 would trend up/left from P3 anchors (if we ended at correct P3 anchors which is unknown) · 3 pitches. Follow. We bailed off the top off p3 cause Alex and Alex got lost and thought we were off route. · Lead / Flash. Fun climb. I led 2 and 4, 2 was really fun and 4 was balancy slab. · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to take and find holds again on P3. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Missed an important crimp on the crux of the third pitch but besides that I did it all without falling. Climbed the first two pitches as one. My first multi pitch. Did it with Thomas and we were both pretty miserable on the last pitch. He had to piss and my feet were killing me. Small skwamas were not the move. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead the crux section and followed the rest. All round great fun, but the exposure as you karate kick out into space is pretty damn cool. · Lead. Led P1, 2, 4; pretty fun, lots and lots of slab. Good view of the wildfires from the top. · 3 pitches. Lead / Onsight. With Woody. Still sick, literally. I have a cold. Also smokey and could see the fire from the top. The 3rd pitch was great pumpy face climbing and 4th worthwhile easier/interesting slab. Woody led 1/2 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on the 3rd pitch, did tiny dancer as second pitch · 3 pitches. Lead. Did first 3 pitches, led p1 although we started on the route to the left since a party on the tombstone. Super sweet moves on p3 around the arete to the jug. And then some hard sporty moves above. Yeehaw · 3 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Tr pitch 1-2 (linked), led pitch 3 OS, very fun. Was shady til ~9am on upper pitch, thing was manageable with a 8am start on a 90+ deg heatwave day. Did not do last pitch b/c full sun · Lead / Onsight. you can link p1 & 2 with 14 draws. gear: 12-14 draws (4 alpine), .75 and 1 · Lead. found the bolting a little contrived with potential for a ledge fall on the first two pitches while clipping bolts from less-than-ideal positions. seemed unnecessary. i am tall, +7” ape. it was wet. .10+ stellar climbing! · Lead / Onsight. w/ Josh. Josh led the first two pitches to place the trad gear, so I took the last two. · 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. Lead P4 only, traversed over from top of 36V. Clean! awesome! exposed but pretty safe, few spicy moves above and to the side of bolts tho. Went left up arete after foot traverse, then high heel step back onto face. Finish to chains spooks. · Lead / Fell/Hung. p3 lead, hung at wild corner and at next crux. Right knee bar arete, left heel & toe hook combo, reach around with left, right to side pull jug, clip bolt. 2nd crux layback left, high right foot, left foot to knob, walk hands up. Fanny pack fell to P1 anc · Lead / Onsight. Led P1 and P3. With Forrest. P3 was awesome! Gets thin on hand holds halfway between the kick and chains. Kick was super fun to get around the arrête! · Lead. Lead the top two pitches. Great route. Took at the main crux but could definitely clean it next time. Just draws and a few slings. · 2 pitches. Lead. Led P3/4. Eric 1/2. Super super fun climbing with great movement · Lead / Fell/Hung. follow p1, p4, lead p2,p3, fell hung on p3 at traverse · Lead / Onsight. would have been my favorite at index if not for the shenanigans. running p. 3&4 together isn't a good idea for communication. climbed with rando (josh) and he did this and we were in blackout for communication. great climb tho · 3 pitches. Lead. Led P1, followed P2 and P3. Bailed at the top of P3 due to no light. Incredible!! · Lead. Took pitches 2, 3, and 4. The P3 cruxes seemed a bit harder to me this time around, with the lower crux just feeling awkward. I took the second crux with a lot of hesitation, but commitment to these two moves made them both go easily. · 3 pitches. Lead / Onsight. First 3 pitches can be linked as 1 mega pitch, super fun and airy. Highly recommended. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led p1/2 (combined) and p4, successfully (p1 not easy) Didn’t follow p3 successfully. Fell going around the horn · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took 1/3 — big fat whip at the crux on p3, was exhilarating — should’ve reached farther to the back of the block. Sarah took 2/4 and crushed · Lead / Fell/Hung. w/ cahir! led p1, 2, 4. A couple falls at the p3 crux. The deadpoint is the way! · 3 pitches. Follow. see P1&2 notes. W/ jai, he led P1&3 (many falls up high, thought he was gonna bail), I led P2. (scary) got dark and P4 looked dirty AF. P3 is WILD, knee bar around arete, reach and match feet. look for round left foot chip under thin crux! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Chris and I climbed Flying Salamanders and traversed into P2. So much fun. I hung at the lie-back section on P3, which was a wimpy thing to do. It's not easy, but it's not as bad as it looks. Ya just have to charge through... Linking P3 and P4 was nice. · 3 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Followed P1, P3 clean. Lead P2. Crack was seeping pretty hard but still climbed. P4 was soaked on the slab traverse so we rapped. · Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Tuna - swapped leads - he took crux pitch. Love the 4th pitch traverse! · 2 pitches. Lead. 2 pitches after Behind the Tombstone and Rope Eating Mice. Lead 3 · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead pitches 2, 4. Took couple of takes on crux sections on pitch 2. Followed pitches 1, 3. · OS, led 2,4. 3 is pumpy and sustained at the grade, 4 is phenomenal slab. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Awesome Karate Kick on Pitch 3. Tough onsight beta for Pitch 3. · Lead / Flash. Led P2 & P3. Would tricky to onsight. I benefited from lots of tick marks · Lead / Onsight. This climb is some of the best bang for the buck in all of Index. Such a good time! · Follow. P1 fun easy, P2 roof bit of tall slab, sketch placementsP3 round the corner scary last twchy funn · Lead / Onsight. With Huckmeister leading all but p3. P4 is the money. Such nice slab in a great position. · Lead / Redpoint. I lead p2/4, both 10a. Dean lead odd pitches. Such a great climb!"

Brought single 0.3-2 and placed three of them, that was a nice rack, rest is bolted. Slipped on initial slab above the first anchor. Can TR with 70m from ground but just barely reaches. · Lead. Went left of rope eating mice to maximize climbing on the undercling rail (cam pro) until pulling over to continue up the boot line to the anchor. Super fun! · Lead / Redpoint. With Steven. Bd 2 bomber piece at start of ramp, then a .4 or .3 before exiting the ramp. A .4/.3 if you want to protect runout on easier climbing to the anchors. · Lead / Onsight. Super rad climb. Very excited to come back when it's less hot to complete the whole RTL line. Would recommend taking a #2 for the first ramp, it fits perfectly and is a bomber piece to start that trad section. I took a single rack from .3-2 and I ended up placing a .3, .5, .75, and a 2. · Follow. fun! (did the first part, link to Ride the Lightning). the upper slab crux isn't too hard, just requires good technique - don't burl into it! has some slightly thin moves off the belay (can protect with a .3 cam before first bolt) · Lead / Onsight. bring cams to .75, you need one for the middle section. With CH · Lead / Pinkpoint. Matt lead first and left a few pieces on right trending ramp. A .4 and 2 on the ramp. Placed a .5 after last bolt on east runout. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Slipped off the finishing moves. Move feet higher before moving left on slab crimps. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Bottom section is really tricky, stick clip second bolt if you can!! Fell there like 3 times. The rest of the route is really fun, the crux (the end) is a little tough. Took a fall because of bad footwork. Use the mega sidepull on the right to get your feet right, then be bold! You’re right at a clip! · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Started on behind the TombstoneUsed .4 on lower pitch , # 2 & .5 on upper. Slipped at last bolt. 70m rope just reached the ground · TR. #2, red purp tot, offset nut. follow jai, I slipped static standing near 3rd bolt. Gear seemed better this time but still weird and broken crack. Crux is after ramp stepping left, match feet on horn was tricky. · 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. led as one long pitch from ground. 8 slings, 8 draws, 2 stiff draws, green alien, blue and yellow metolius, .3 BD, #1 BD, and brassie with green swage or #2 cam · Lead / Fell/Hung. Draws were hung, gear 2, .3, .4, .5. Really spooked trying to make a move off a ledge. · Lead / Redpoint. Linked with Behind the Tombstone and lowered to the ground with a 70M (just barely!) · Lead / Redpoint. place #2 on start of ramp (unclip after placing #1), blue and yellow metolius, and .3BD. Could possibly place brassie in small righthand crack instead of #2 behind flake. · Lead / Flash. Kinda assisted on the gear to sort out rope that kinda got tangled, but otherwise clean; not sure to call it flash or fell/jung · Lead / Onsight. RTLw/ jai. Thin holds and feet, big reaches, and the no bolt ramp has shit rock and gear. all totems except purp, bring 0.2 & #2, gear mostlysucked but climbing wasn't super hard there. yel tot was good and protected heel hook/mantle. needs+2 bolts. Scary · TR. Followed Arturo to First Anchor, then lead to second anchor for the rappel."

Shares anchor with the 5.9+ this honestly felt harder to me at least than the Anthropocene 5.9+ to the left. The traverse is definitely the highlight of this route. Super fun and extremely juggy! · Lead / Redpoint. Took two tries to send. Much more confident the second time, but still froze for a bit at the crux. · Lead / Onsight. Climbing with Ashley, Audrey, Kai and Sophie following on TR. Fun line, shares the anchors with climb to the left, The Anthropocene. Top of route is a little contrived as it traverses left to connect with the anchors above The Anthropocene. · TR. TR to clean; went a lot smoother without lead head worries, but even hotter up top by then. · Lead / Onsight. Headiest 5.9 I've ever done, I think. I probably was too high on the traverse, and the sun was on that part of the wall and it was scorching. · Lead / Onsight. Monica tried to lead and had to bail at second bolt. I finished it up. Felt very stiff for 5.8+. Monica later sent on top rope. · Lead / Flash. First one we did on Friday! Fun slab with some interesting movement · Lead / Flash. Feet were toasted. lol doing this as last route of day wasn’t a good idea. But super fun route! Bomber hands all the way. · Lead / Onsight. Go LEFT after 6 or 7 bolt shares anchors with the root to the left · Lead / Onsight. Does it count if i accidentally went up and right two bolts instead of bearing left and then had to bail off said bolt with no anchor in sight and then later KC had to rescue my draw. If u ask me it does · TR. Attempted on lead, thwarted by the crux. Made it through on TR. Key is to stay low and move left toward the other route (but don’t clip the wrong anchor) · Lead / Onsight. Had a weird unknown traverse after the 7th bolt. Didn’t realize it went over. · Lead / Onsight. First climb at Index. May have it mixed up with Anthropocene. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Couple scary traverse moves as it goes left. Last two bolts. · Lead / Flash. SUPER fun traverse at the end with a cool final move · Lead / Flash. Climbed with nick. Lead this route just after he tried, got off track, and meandered the wall for and hour."

It had a few routes in the 80s that nobody climbed due to it being off the beaten path, but all the while it was clear to anyone who bushwhacked over there that the wall had excellent potential for numerous classics. Then, after the nearby Halloween was developed during the pandemic of 2020-2022, developers inspired by the late Michal R- made a trail to Zappa from Halloween and started unearthing the long buried gems.Zappa has some excellent cracks, some futuristic roofs, and some slab. A few routes have easy-to-set TRs, but most require a lead and most are trad. And still there is much potential.",
    "area_getting_there": "Start by hiking to Halloween. From the east end of Halloween, near the base of Resting Witch Face, look for the trail going down and east. Follow trail for about 5-10 minutes, which should take you close to some steep walls for the last few minutes before going uphill to the base of Zappa. The first cleaned route you'll encounter is Azure Winged Magpie. A minute later you meet the main wall just below Pussamus and Turtles Bong Rip.",

Then took a couple tries to move past the last bolt- but he did it and it was awesome. I made it to the last bolt before I had to take on TR. definitely some physical moves to get past the cruxy last moves- took a couple of tries. Definitely right heel hooking and slapping your way up the right side, with some left foot smearing to help you move up. Some fun, crazy movement. · Lead / Onsight. For festival comp. Slightly offbalance climbing to slopey fridge slappin up top. Was actively sliding down at crux, somehow found a nub on R face and kept on. Fun! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Whipped a lot on that last bolt, the compression boulder problem is hard. From the left hand jug get right hand on the nub that’s lower then expected then get left foot up and left hand goes up to slap that slopper then right hand goes up to juggy arete · Lead / Fell/Hung. Couldn’t get past second bolt, and clipped it to start. V hard · Lead / Redpoint. 10/10 so much fun. Tech to more tech to beautiful arete movement up high. Do this thing. · TR. Great route. Many falls. Would love to get it dialed then lead. Also not bad for the skin. · TR. fun layback with thoughtful feet the first half. Got stuck at after the last bolt with jug on left arete. Top of arete is a sloper. went left. · Lead / Flash. w/ Waiwai. 5.10 may or may not be a sandbag, but no harder than Index 5.11- · TR. felt much more reasonable up until the final crux which felt the same. Hard to TR solo because of the way the rope runs. Need to remember a rope protector or lead it · Lead / Redpoint. 2nd go. Awesome and a bit frightening. High left toe at the end was crucial. · TR. Top seems impossible. Alex claims heel hook on the right, smear w/ left foot on the face · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took the whip a few times, then climbed the womb to tr · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got beat down. Top felt impossible on a hot day with little chalk and bad beta. Use a sneaky right crimp and a little foot chip around the right side. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Another failure on Lead. Tr lap with Jonathan beta getting better for crux (rest of route goes well!). Crux beta from good hold: reach right to hidden pocket, left foot to knob on left side, right foot to biggest knob in middle of wall, slap *high*, mantl · Lead / Fell/Hung. Whipped a bunch, fun to work hard above my grade. Couldn't figure out last problem before chains -, couldn't find holds to get over top. Try again on a colder day. Went around side to access chains. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took some pretty nasty falls. Some bone bruising in the back of my low calf from nailing the r edge of the arete and bloody knees but nothing serious. Was expecting index 10+ and went to battle. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Scary Lead. Super insecure the whole time. Took on the first 2 bolts. Sent the crux at the top · Lead / Redpoint. Not as bad as your typical MR sandbag as soon as you suss out the beta. Not a 10+!!! · Lead / Fell/Hung. With Luke. End of day, superb pitch but very very tricky. · Lad today. Pretty good until the last move to the top. Took multiple whippers. Then used diff beta and cruised it on TR"

Triples of in between sizes, but didn’t use any of my #3 cams. · TR. Max lead. Ethan and Haley TRd. I definitely want to lead this next time. Great pro. Max brought triples of medium stuff and 2 each of #4 and #5. · Lead / Onsight. Amazing climb. Feels like a Yosemite pitch with an awesome belay ledge. Used a single rack and #4. · Lead / Onsight. Funky, grovelly, enjoyable Placed a 4 and 5 but could have left the 5 if I didn’t love it so much · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led it in 85* sun after rattletale so felt like a terrible slog. Look forward to another time. I was definitely wishing for .1-00 cams that I didn’t have with so a #5 was required · Follow. Nick Led. I could lead. Bring 2 4s and a 5 and will likely feel alright! · Follow. Sustained, 3x #1, plenty of balancy rests once past the finger crack. Don't forget the #4 · TR. Great climb. Kendra lead. Have to rap left side to top of gully and use the hand line. Full 70 · Lead / Onsight. Max lead. Haley followed. What an amazing climb that really does have it all! OW, jams, fingers, a little bit of chimney and sport! It was very physical and exhausting! But so fun! Especially on TR · Lead / Redpoint. I saved the four and then never placed it. Placed the five to get my knee unstuck lol so that was cool. With Jess, maple stayed home :’( · Follow. Full body workout as always, such a great and varied climb! 2 #4s and a #5 is best. Straight in jamming the pod at the bottom worked well. Bump #5 up wide crack near the top. · Lead. As fun if not more fun then rattle tale. So much different climbing stacked into one route · Lead. hung since I didn't have a second 4. if only bringing one, save for the upper section. fun, long, varied climb with a great ledge at the top. 5.9 in the book · Follow. Bring 4 for near the top. Beautiful .3 finger crack followed by the crux of the flared double crack. Enjoyable and long route · Lead / Redpoint. Slipped on the second move of flash attempt. Sent clean on second attempt · Lead / Fell/Hung. The start was a little awkward with wide hands. once gaining the ledge, the next section is thin fingers in a dihedral that I took on a couple instances. eventually you gain the left wife crack where I'm glad I brought the #5. bumped it for a bit to place a nice but and get into the chimney section. The chimney and upwards was pretty chill and easy climbing. This feels harder than a 10a, but maybe that's because I don't like thin fingers. · Climbed with Karthik - I thought this was a quite technical pitch with many different climbing styles needed. · Follow. Long Sustained tough climbing. Bulge right off the deck, hands up to fingers, switch to left crack system. Tried to lead, fell on start twice. Bring extra gear, maybe trips in fingers to hands · Follow. Starting off width was hard. Need to work on that. Ended up cheating it with a layback · Follow. Start is the crux. Flared down and out makes the feet- or leg- jam difficult. Good hand jams lead into finger cracks and off width cracks. Off width to the left is way too big for my foot and too narrow for a knee or leg jam. Chimney move afterwards. Then lots of manteling to the top. · Lead / Onsight. Long and physical Single .2 to .4,, triple .5 to 2, double #3, 4. Probably can go with just double everything, but I was happy to have extras. I did use a .2 · Follow. Start was the hardest part, felt like grovely climbing most of the way for me. · Follow. Such a long pitch. I’m giving myself the clean follow even though I had to take to clean a 0.4 Adam had wedged. · Lead / Onsight. Sooo good! Definitely need to have your second follow up to clean this properly / easily. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung at the crux down low; didn’t see the nice rest behind me. Didn’t have any issues with the rest. #4 was very nice to have and the #5 was super nice and convenient for bumping. No double #4 needed. Could redpoint. · Lead / Onsight. Super fun. Lots of variety of moves. 70m will reach the rocks off climber's left (TM) · Lead / Onsight. Very stoked on this. Definitely suggest racking two 4s, one 5. Would not feel comfortable on this route without that. · Lead / Redpoint. basically 2x 0.4-#2, triple #1 (could use 4x down low, middle crack switch, then before and after roof but can use bd #2 after if careful), carried 2x #3 to the chains. bumped 4 & 5 though middle leaving some small gear and nuts, left 5 and took 4 then used near top. small 2 offset cams, didn't use blk or blu tot. crux is the start! belay from top, 80m rope for 1rap · Lead / Onsight. Fun. 2x 4s wouldn't go unused....or 1x 4 and 1x 5 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Couple falls at the bottom, don’t put a 3 in or you’ll take up holds and, 1 take at finger..super sweating · Lead / Onsight. Challenging. Felt like 5.10. Gear:double small to 5”, nuts, slings. Did it with a single 4” and 5” and bumped the 5” A LOT!!! · Lead / Flash. Much more awkward than Rattletale, but easier to lead, better rests, got it clean. Used single #0.5, doubles #0.75-3, and single #4 bumping it up till used nuts in small crack instead of #5. Didn't use my #0.3-0.4's. Used lots of draws! Two rappels with 60m were nice. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to yo yo down for the 4, glad to have the 5. Felt more burly than rattletale for sure. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Bullshit hang down low when hand crack narrows. Just send it next time. · Lead / Onsight. w/ Cody. This was a long, burley one that took a lot of gear. Glad I pushed through and got it clean - awesome belay ledge up top. #4 and #5 would've been used. · Lead / Onsight. So much better than I was expecting. Beautiful belay ledge at the top. Do this route! · Lead. Such variety. think this would get better with reps as you figure out a flow. would benefit from more traffic, but is worth a go as is. #5 can definitely be placed but isn't necessary. #4 was appreciated. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Cruxy down low- nice to have a 4, 5 up high. Need to rap- bring ATC and down climb from big boulder · Lead / Fell/Hung. LONG, used triple rack 0.4-2, 2x#3, black totem & 0.2/0.3 offset, couple nuts, 4&5 bumped up for wide w/ small gear to right, would have run out otherwise. Took twice getting off ground, crux, rest A FIGHT but clean. 2raps 70m using anchor climber's left. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Bring double rack to 4 next time, and a 5 if available · Lead / Onsight. Super good. Crux was the finger crack/layback, but the OW stembox part was very interesting"

Glad to have sent this without tree, but perhaps that made it harder. Pretty fun! · Lead / Onsight. Odd route, but it makes you think! Worth your time but definitely harder than a 5.8. you can easily get away with only using gear larger than .5, and youll need atleast 1 #4 for the middle. Also, if the tree is not on, this route would be a lot harder · Lead. swallows gear. used most of a double rack. aided off the tree to set an anchor. bit awkward with the wall there · Lead / Fell/Hung. Mid section was tough for me, but the upper crack was great! My foot slipped off the tree but I was caught by a bomber handjam. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Wow, that was a hard lead. Had to aid up several spots. Definitely having doubles of 0.75-3 was useful! Used a #4 also. Tricky crack technique. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on the top. Didn’t see the good foothold. Used tree"

Crack which starts as perfect hands and finishes as wide hands (or layback).P3: Deep corner slot, also right-facing, with two cracks. You can do a wide stem and jam the thinner, right crack.

The top is an incut edge, bordering on the forest.Lower from the P3 bolted anchor and have your follower clean the anchor and then lower back to the P2 bolted anchor.

Max flashed pitch 2 this time. He used #2x4, #3x2, and #1x1. I climbed using mostly fists instead of laybacks this time and it killed me. I had a few takes. Would love to practice more. Tape up right wrist next time. 3rd pitch was so fun. We both stemmed until halfway up, then switched to the right crack. Gear .4-3 x2. · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. 1st clean second pitch lots of take and bump due to limited gear · Lead / Redpoint. A fine day out with Daniel, stoked to send this thing. 5.10Burly · Lead / Fell/Hung. W/ Esteban. P1: Esteban lead, I followed. Nothing too hard or interesting. P2: I lead. Took a fall half way up. Def hard. Jamming the start felt good but as it got steeper it became difficult. And laybacking it just takes so much energy. Took a big whipper!! Was completely out of breath at the top. P3: Esteban lead first, then I lead. Very fun pitch! Money pitch of the climb for sure. Stem until a nice ledge for feet and start jamming them. Money jug at the top! Overall: great climb to push myself on, pro is bomber, very worthy of its four stars! · Lead / Onsight. Onsighted pitch 1 and took on pitch 3. Followed pitch 2 · Lead. Led P2, followed P1 and P3. P2 felt way harder than the other pitches. Only pieces that fit into P2 that I brought were a Metolius 6, a BD #2, and a WC #3. Ended up hanging a bunch on that pitch and was bumping those cams up HARD until the 2-inch pieces tipped out, then ran it out to the top. Would not recommend, just buy more gear instead. Maybe being one or two WC #2s since the upper crack is too thin at the entrance for a #3 but widens in back. · Lead. Led 2/3 w Jon. Very fun! One stupid take midway P2 bc it was 88° full sun insanely greasy but could send. Shocked by how much I liked the wide hands · Lead / Onsight. Led the first pitch, Sauer led the second and Matt led the third. Jacob followed. · Lead / Onsight. Elliot led the first, I led second, Matt and I both led the third! Jacob climbed the first and hung out on the ledge below the second! · Lead / Redpoint. Led all 3. With Liz. 1 year since failing on p2, felt totally casual this time. · Lead / Onsight. Aaron led p1; we each led p3 P2 was wide for my dainty paws and left me cupping much of the upper section (3’s). Super fun and lovely. Had it to ourselves · Lead. Lead p1 and p3 then got throttled by rain and hail! Jammed thru p2 this time which was hard but fun · Lead / Onsight. Os p1 & 2, Ri did 3, one of my favorite routes of all time! · Lead. 4 #2 (bring WC 2s for the top) and one #3 for p2 crux · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led p 2, hung near the top, whole thing is SO GOOD · Lead / Redpoint. Led pitch 2 for the first time: 2 takes at crux 2/3-3/4 up. Led pitch 3 for the second time: red pointed it. · Lead / Redpoint. Did it all clean! Led 1 & 3. Happy to get back on it. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Attempted pitch 2 lead. Jam higher than you think (until a foot hold shows up out right) 3x2, 3x3 and a 4. For last pitch just wide stem to good hand jams · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell once on pitch 2 and took a couple times. Hands are too big for jams and too small for fists. And too wide for fists up high, had to layback the entire thing, felt super burly. Pitch 3 was lots of fun · Follow. Fun fun fun. Food for thought solo seems doable maybe check it out first pitch wouldnt be that bad to down solo · Lead. Led pitches 2+3, pitch 2 extremely pumpy but stoked to get the send! · Lead p1, followed 2,3. P2 was too big for me hands—had to lie back and got wrecked · 2 pitches. Lead / Flash. 2x #2, 3x #3, purple metolius. Go back for that last pitch! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Slipped out! It’s hot and sweaty out! Felt good besides that · Lead / Onsight. Super super fun, linked p1&2 then followed p3 off Naomi’s lead. Really fun stuff · Lead / Onsight. Spencer led pitch one, I led pitch two (EPIC SPLITTER), David led pitch three. · Lead. Lead pitch one, followed pitch 2+3. Did have to take on pitch 2 right before roof. · Lead / Fell/Hung. My favorite route evahhhh!!! So good. Needed a take at the crux of p2 and where p3 was wet. Excited to come back and send again and again · Lead / Redpoint. Lead pitch 1 & 3.Ethan lead pitch 2.Austin climbed with us for the lols:) · Lead / Flash. Lead second pitch. So good!! Gear was (2) 2s, 2 1/2, 3 · Lead / Onsight. Led the 5.9, the second pitch was soooo burly and hard for me. The third pitch was wet. Come back for it! Looked so fun! · Lead. Haley lead first pitch. So fun. Max lead the second. He had one fall about 2/3rds of the way up. Definitely could use 3 #2 BD cams for this climb. Max flashed in 2nd go on TR. Haley flashed on TR, but I switched to lay back climbing after crack got too wide for me. Next time just practice true crack technique! We didn’t get to do the 3rd pitch as it was too wet. Next time! · Lead / Onsight. Very classy route. Led all pitches, 3rd was wet. Really enjoyed this one. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led 2nd pitch. Bailed on 3rd pitch because it was quite wet · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell right as P2 hand crack ended and crack widens just a little. So close! P3 too wet to climb · Lead / Flash. led p2 after a trash!!! so so so so fun— splitter 2s into 2.5s into 3s at the top and STEEP!! My hardest crack lead! · Follow. 1st pitch slimy but fun. Second pitch literally perfect no notes. 3rd pitch slimy stemming VERY fun, tried offwidth/chimney to left and bailed back to stem/jam right · Lead / Redpoint. Crux felt much easier this time around with two functional crack gloves on the crux pitch. Move quickly with your gear planned out and it’ll be fine. Used one red, yellow, and blue C4, one yellow friend. Stay relaxed, breath, keep the bicep relaxed and thumb cammed hard and cruise through the bulge. P3 stem start is the way to do it, even with some partial seepage (rained the previous day/night). Ran it out a bit but it’s secure. P1 had a harder bit that made me feel it’s almost up to the .9 grade. Just not very sustained. Did the OW on the third pitch on TR for a bonus lap. Cheated with a stem a little bit at the start moving through the broken up blocks in the crack, but otherwise sent clean. Felt hard, and was glad to be hitting cardio lately. Expand chest in the bottom to get rests, use rotated body squeeze technique at the top. · 2 pitches. Lead. Pumpy posing for photos for the new guidebook w/ Ben, Q, and Melanie · 2 pitches. TR. First pitch (5.9) was cruiser and fun! Would lead. Second pitch was FUN but I got hauled up it. Struggled with the crack size but after learned to jam my hands deeper and use my forearms. Definitely something to work on and go back for in the future. · Lead / Onsight. Followed 1, lead 2, belayed Freddie on 3 then gave it a lead myself. P2 I used 2 2s then 2 3s, switched to layback just after my first 3. P3 was wet and slimy, stemmed up to just below the first big pod, placed a .75, a 3 and 2 in the pod then a 3 before the top. With a 70 you can lower from the top to the P1 anchors then lower your second from the P2 to P1 anchors then rap P1. · 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Led p2. P3 is wet, slimy, rapped down (same as another party) · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead 1st pitch clean (easier and less sustained than Senior Citizens) Cruised first half of 2nd pitch on TR with perfect jams then went too fast when it got wider and slipped out. James placed 4 #2s and one #3 on the exit. Worth placing a #1 at the start in order to get first #2 placed higher and it would be perfect. 3rd pitch was wet so we did one rap to bottom. · 2 pitches. Fantastic as always. Skipped p3 due to seeping. We both took turns leading p2, so fun. Placed 2 #2s and 2 #3s on p2. · 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. sent pitches 1&2, pitch 3 was soaked so a no go. onsight pitch 1 red point pitch 2 after following. will have to go back for 3 when conditions are better · Lead / Onsight. Led p2 and 3. P3 soaking wet still. P2 softest 10 at index for fat hands · Noah led 1&3. I led 2, hung, rack gear on left side next time · Lead / Fell/Hung. Need 4x #2’s for P2, rack 0.5-4 with double 0.5-2 is prolly perfect plus nuts · 1 pitch. Lead. W/Chad the middle pitch is a lot more mellow then I thought every pitch was good! · 1 pitch. Follow. Only the first pitch, funzies, try more of it next time · Lead / Redpoint. ITS JUST SO GOOD I WANT TO DO THIS EVERYDAY. led all 3 pitches for Alissa but she only did the first. so technically I led all three pitches for myselfffff · Lead / Pinkpoint. Tried to link p1 & p2 - had to hang due to rope drag. Lowered and then did partial pinkpoint of p2. Flashed p3. · 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. did pitches 1 and 2 because YES and linked em and oworred with a 76m rope. THAT CRACK IS GOD · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead P1 and P3. Followed P2. Eats up 2s on P2. Without tape my hands kept slipping and getting cut. Stem P3 · Lead. p2. hung at the last number 2. not enough endurance but that is what you get for being a desk boy. classic climbing, the stuff you dream of. · Lead / Onsight. Hung twice on second pitch. On-sighted one and three. Perfect day. Beautiful climb · 4 pitches. Lead. Followed P1 an P3 clean. Sent P2 on lead. Short but awesome pitches! TR on OW variation on P3 · Lead / Fell/Hung. lead P1 &3 whipped before rest on p3 way good. but hot in the sun · Lead / Onsight. Swap with Garrett, I lead P2. Pitches are short but great!"

Gotta get better at #4's!! Used 0.2-0.5 + #5, doubles of 0.75-#2 + #4s, and three #3's. · TR. Very fun, it felt like a 5.7 that I did somewhere else in Index? Just very strenuous, but very secure. I’d like to lead this next season (??). · Lead / Onsight. W/ Esteban, Maya, and Sheep. Went into it thinking it was a 5.7 and got a bit surprised when the crack turned into #1 size (thin hands for me). Knowing its a .9 makes a lot more sense. Good climb and satisfying to completely shove yourself into the crack, but not my favorite. · TR. Perfect hands for the massive crack at top. Reminds me of Skywalker but instead of finger jams it’s perfect hands. Remember at the very end look up and you should have jugs on the ‘roof’ right before the anchor. · TR. One hang at the beginning, didnt trust foot jam. Great practice! But also awful · TR. The most fun I’ve ever had on a rope. The off-width portions are sick!!!! Get on this!!! · Lead / Redpoint. Three 3s, two 4s was much better. Still some wide spacing. Another 3 wouldn't hurt. · Lead / Fell/Hung. led from the top of the TR on the left and screwed up the transition at the top. Then TR from the base and it went better. Offwidth section is 5.7 · Lead / Fell/Hung. First index 5.9! Predictably had to take at the wide 3/4 layback. Just climb quick next time! Finally remembered to start the panini press (#5 section) facing out after unsuccessfully thrutching facing in for a while. Placed 1 .2, 3 .75s, 1 #1-2, 3 #3s, 2 #4s, and 1 #5. Fixed #4 is now gone. Didn’t need any finger sizes. · TR. Led from Wild Turkey anchors, TRed below. No more stuck cams and didn't have the wide stuff. · Lead. Wanted three or four 3s and two 4s. Didn't have them, ran it out. Didn't feel great. · TR. Layback the flaky section, could've gastoned + right foot jam, to stay closer to the crack for lead purpose. Entered the chimney too early, body stucked there and couldn't move around. Could've climbed a bit higher until the crack is wider and face holds are available. Chimney climbed (back on one side and feet on the other side) last section. I probably couldn't lead this as the crack is too deep to reach to place pro for me. · Follow. feel like i want at least two 4s to try leading this, two 3s? in addition to the fixed 3 and 4 · TR. Definitely felt battered, last climb of the day, but didn’t slip or fall on TR and felt safe enough to lead next time with fresh arms · Lead / Onsight. Great climb. Has some hands and some wide. Up to 5. Maybe a 6. Could maybe use 2 4s. 0.75 for top. Great climb. With sarah. She said \"one of my favorite granite pitches. · TR. Led the last section, but didn't bother to lead the whole thing again. Very fun! Found two big cams stuck firmly in the crack · Follow. One of my favorite granite pitches ever. First part was kind of physical and hard moves, then the offwidth which takes some figuring out. I ended up facing left through the offwidth and that worked. Then a beautiful 2s crack to a slab, sooo fun. Erron led. Would not lead this at this point in time · Lead / Redpoint. Do again. Poor style; bring single rack with double #3s and black totems. 00 and .1 might be handy for the top. · Lead / Onsight. Epic lead. Did it add the sun went down, fought hard at top to not stay pumped. · Lead / Onsight. Major grovel through the second half. Pretty fun! Definitely felt stiff for the grade. Secure but physical · Lead / Onsight. Bruh, climbed it with a single 3, thank god for fixed gear · Lead / Fell/Hung. Bailed but got farther than last time. Still working on foot work in the offhands · TR. don't know if i'd call this fun but it's definitely climbing. fixed 3 and fixed 4. · TR. Max lead clean to SCIS chains. Haley trd. I struggled in the middle where it got wider for me. Next time max needs to lead to the top. I feel like I could lead as gear placement is solid. · TR. Crux was #4 section before the panini press. In the press, nice #2s then narrowing to .75. Right when you’re feeling the squeeze, exit to slab. .2 before the top out, then the top out feels spicy but there are overhead jugs. · Lead / Onsight. Felt 5.9 for normal hands ppl, way harder if you've got smaller proportions · TR. Nice. The \"battered\" part was not nearly as bad I as I remember it. Just stayed straight in with hand jams all the way till you gotta transition out. The crux for me is before that, when it's kinda wide and laybacky. · Lead. Hung once on offwidth, then found a good patch for my left foot on the edge to start thruching · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hopped on this to clean gear after Jocelyn hurt her ankle. Thought I’d see how it felt compared to the first time, maybe because I was in a rush because it was getting cold/dark, or because I was sloppy, but the crux still kicked my ass! Took me a few times to get my foot situated on a butterfly jam in order to reach the next hold. Top was fun and less hard! · Lead / Onsight. Super great climb. General shoes with sticky rubber were perfect. I only had one 4 and no 5s so I had to take my time and bump up the four a ways. There’s a stuck 3 I clipped too. 4* · Lead / Fell/Hung. Feels more like a 5.9+ because of the off-width section. Great climb though, had to take at knee/hip jam section · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell and injured both heels on the ledge. Need to come back and send this. · Lead / Fell/Hung. I got battered. Would have been nice to have a second #4. Very stuck #3 and #5 were well appreciated. · Lead. Wished I'd brought extra 3's & 4's for the middle. Top chimney takes a rainbow of gear. · Lead / Redpoint. Felt much more confident, smooth, and secure this time around. Uses some knees for squeeze technique but not much. Gear wise, took doubles 0.75-3, singles down to 0.3 and up to 5. Didn’t need the 0.3. Saving some hand sized gear for the top bit would be a good idea. Probably a 2 and 0.75 or a 3 and 1 would do the trick."

Move to come out of alcove to layback is pee’ hard · TR. It was getting pretty hot so didn’t lead. Thin crack crux is mainly just spooky/scary not that hard · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got that ass beat. Had to aid the last crux. Many falls. · TR. Perhaps could lead. Thin section would be intimidating! Shimmy sideways to get into final handcrack · Just great rock climbing too bad there are big ledges would be better is fully sustained · Lead / Fell/Hung. 30+ foot whip from the finger section to the second horizontal of the zig zag below my first piece. Bad belayer. Second fall from the chimney getting to the hand jam. · TR. Corner climbs pretty reasonably, but getting into thin hands out of chimney is fucking hard · 1 pitch. Dope climb. My friend puked up his index general store burrito at the crux"

The crack is chefs kiss, not sure about the low crux though. · TR. I made the first move after a half dozen tries and then fell off and gave up but still felt accomplished · 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. 5 goes. Forgot my shoes and had to run back and get them got it on second go of the day with Jonathan we both sent back to back send train and music from the art festival! Awesome! · Lead / Redpoint. Bday send with Jack and Brandon! So psyched. Fav index climb so far · Lead / Fell/Hung. Use middle crimp at first crux, middle finger an ring finger at second crux. 2 .3 2 .4s 1 black totem · Lead / Redpoint. Had a bear of a day, perfect way to finish it off. First go today, third session. · 3 pitches. TR. 3 burns, figured out lower slab crux plus finger crack, but definetly not the dyno traverse. Wish the finger crack could just be by itself. So fun. · 3 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Ayyy three full lead burns and it goes down (with Melissa) · Lead / Redpoint. Psyched! Super cool route. First go this day grabbed the draw doing the slab dyno but cruised to top. Send it 3rd or 4th go · 3 pitches. TR. Worked this out on TR solo. First two tries the mantle and dyno felt really impossible, but right foot flat with heel down made the mantle go. 3rd go did it clean didn’t feel too bad. Really sick route! · TR. Not my best attempt. Was dirty and still a bit wet from the recent rain. · TR. got that pistol squat!!! slab dyno still feels impossible, but slightly closer with a left foot rotation adjustment. For starting big crack move, get a VERY high left foot first · 4 pitches. TR. TR solo. Managed to link from the bottom to the top! Just gotta lead it now. · 3 pitches. TR. TR soloed this today. Was able to work all the moves! Very cool! It felt impossible the first time, but I slowly figured out each section. Crazy side · 4 pitches. TR. Multiple laps tr solo. Clean to the 2nd bolt, and clean above the 4th, but between 2 and 4 is completely fucked · TR. Fell off the crimps on the pistol squat crux and on the traverse. Would lead. Hurt shoulder · Lead / Fell/Hung. Chuffed at the pistol squat but sent the rest. Rotate the left heel in, lh out rh up, lean over further than you think, stand up. Probably butt in too. 1 .1, 1 .2, 3 .3, 1-2 .4, 2 .5, 1 .75, 1 1. 2x .2-.5, 1x .1, .75-1 probably goes too. · Lead / Flash. First lead go. Seshed on tr solo to dial moves. Very very fun route. Some of the best movement I’ve done. Favorite climb in WA. · 2 pitches. TR. squat and pockets feel unlikely, rest is doable. good gear good rests. use aggro shoes next time for pocket crux feet. · TR. Hard! Onsighted the low boulder (dyno), couldn’t do the mantle, traverse slab dyno move, or the crack start · Fell a lot working out the slab boulder. Linked from finger crack to top. · TR. with Matt and Victor. really difficult slab. Finger cracks are awesome. pretty hard. need more strength. · TR. TR solo. I fell crossing the slab and a few times at the beginning of the crack. What an excellent climb! · Lead / Redpoint. w/ letty, v proud of this one, slab dino for small bois, v classic · Lead / Fell/Hung. This thing is a hard 11c, but supper safe. There is one 11+ crack move but most of the business is on the face. · TR. Start: side pull out left, get feet up on both littl knobs, pushed my right hand in the razor blade to numb foot up there, then I can get the good hold. Second crux there’s a right undercling, pistol squat hard on right foot Slab dyno, go duckfooted with left foot as far right as possible. Fall into hold, it’s good, don’t fall off on smears. Crack crux, crack right hand pocket, grab next as a side pull/ Gaston, left knobby foot, then good right hand in the same little pod, then you can get jams. Crack is easy from there. · TR. awesome awesome route. steep crack was super fun. hard start. couldn't figure out all of the moves at the face crux traverse before the crack · Lead / Fell/Hung. W Martin. The final exam of “index 11c” - pistol squats, body scums, splitter finger cracks, this thing has it all. Amazing, and hard! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Quadruple .3 and .4 means you never need to worry about gear but is excessive. .2 or .5 protects top out. Green c3 after traverse is nice for the last slab move (can back clean after clipping bolt). A locker draw would be really nice for the second bolt. · TR. Got all the moves, but not sure they will go together without more work. Second crux come in from left. Traverse crux is a dynamic grab and prey move. Start of finger crack is powerful, but quickly drops in difficulty. Beautiful route · Lead / Redpoint. WoooOO with Jess and Maple first go today. —tried it once Friday two hang · Lead / Flash. Flashed! Thanks to a helpful spray down from the index family · with Mateo and Leon. TR, then 2 leads. At best, I hung 3 times I think. Psyched for rematch. · TR. Worked some of the moves. Got the start, couldn’t do the mantle or dead point or finger pocket pull. Crack above was super fun finger locks though · Lead / Redpoint. TRed for first time (once) last weekend. Lead once Thursday and fell. Lead and sent today. · TR. Really good climbing, be fun to work on it a bit in cooler temps · TR. Gotta practice my pistol squats now. Couldn’t figure out the slab lean over after. Alana said “just fall” · TR. Really cool. Two cruxes for me: first was the mantle below the second bolt. Second was after the last bolt in the crack… right hand in the weird pod, some foot beta to work out, then bust to the bad left hand jam/side pull. Lightens up but still challenging fingers crack · TR. sent on TR again, got the crack entry move clean again. pistol squat was a bit shaky this time. · Lead / Redpoint. 5.10 if your under 5’7? One of the best routes I’ve ever done. Yosemite blows · Lead / Redpoint. After Adam’s send! Possibly the best pitch I’ve done in Index. 2nd go · Lead / Fell/Hung. July 2021 - Gave this an honest ground up attempt and got shut down pretty hard, pulled on all the crux draws · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got the moves - fell at crux mantel, dyno, and pocket dead point · Lead / Redpoint. 3rd go. I’m 5’9” and don’t dyno. That move isn’t reachy for me, I just have to be in the right position to trust fall to it. · TR. Unique sequence of challenges. Three climbs combined into one epic. Oddly, my crux was the balance mantle to enter the slab dyno. · TR. hard throughout w/ numerous hangs. mantling onto the rail seemed impossible. sideways dyno low % · Lead / Redpoint. finally sent it! got the boulder moves into the crack. high right foot along rail is key · Lead / Fell/Hung. follow the six steps. use pinks, not tc pros. keep core tension. · Lead / Fell/Hung. crux: rt hd pocket, rt ft goes up high. lt ft goes up small nub. rt ft smears or goes into right hole. Lt ft goes out and up to small insecure dish, weight lt ft. rt ft moves up along mini arete, left hd up into hole. rt ft up to arete, rt hd in jam · 2 pitches. TR. Amazing route! A couple attempts. Did both the crux moves after a few tries on each. TRonsighted finger crack section! · TR. fell at the traverse and finger pocket. need a few more TRs to get this · 3 pitches. TR. Tr solo. Eventually worked all moved except getting onto the pedestal at the second bolt. Way over my lead pay grade but worth the tr training! · TR. Holy cow this is tough. I could barely get up it with gravity assist XD. Lives up to the sandbag · TR. It'd be amazing to redpoint or even cleanly TR this climb. I fell and hung a few times. · Lead / Redpoint. top roped this a couple times and then sent, awesome route! classic index slab trickery, reminded me of model worker, to an awesome finger crack · Lead / Redpoint. awesome route! slab move is wild and the finger crack stay on you til the end · Lead / Redpoint. Amazing! For draws and a optional .5 get you to the crack. Gear for crack is straight forward · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. 2nd go blew a foot and ripped out of the top of the finger crack. Ouch."

Aided above the cave to get my feet back in the game. · TR. Cheated the initial part of the crack, and the part above the small cave. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Right finish variation, pumped out after completely botching the gear. Felt way more secure in the thin hands than any previous attempts · TR. right, right variation, establishing the hand crack up high is harrrd. 3 #1s. thrashed around for a while grating my tips. · Lead / Redpoint. Tough getting up and over from cave and into the overhanging crack on the right. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Botched the opening boulder problem and came down to start over · TR. boulder start felt hard, right line through the chimney was difficult as well. Should try left line next time. · TR. Bouldery start is hard, and even on TR had to aid through the lip section to get to the final hand crack · Lead / Redpoint. Lead R fin and left finish. Didn’t like the finish, grovely and awk. R finish is much cooler · Lead. Lead the top part since cam ran out of cams, very cool move out of that cave · Lead / Redpoint. Aid with Lindsey! Pre season gong sounds. Meanwhile at senior citizens someone’s triple rack is slowly flopping like an amoeba in a tide pool down the side of private Idaho and nine crag dogs are running infinity symbols into the dirt. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell off the right stem box at the top probably mid 10 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Take on a right finish. Bomber 0.5 at the roof. Layback with thin hands. Suck it up and reach the good hand 1.5 m higher. · TR. really hard start for a 10a, couldn't quite reach the fingers so I used the left rail and ended up with feet in the finger crack which would not work on lead. then it sounds like you are supposed to move right into the upper face at the top, which is harder than 10a (I gave up) and has no pro · Lead / Fell/Hung. Aided through the first moves and then the 10a section at the top. Clean otherwise. Ended at a very dirty gulley. Placed a lot (3-4ea) of .75 - 3, plus some smaller pieces and a #4. Led the pillar section much more cleanly: foot up and then R hand jam above the loose block and then stand up. · TR. Clean until I tried to go up the slab instead of the dirty gulley. No idea how that slab is 10a! Probably had some rope boost at the bottom too. · Lead / Redpoint. Took 4-5 tries to get the first move into the finger crack. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Aided off a .2 for the beginning moves / boulder problem. Then hung in the number 3 crack. The hollow blocks are spooky but there’s a good #1 placement above the obvious hollow circle ack at the beginning of the #3 crack. I bailed a few pieces above this. Scott finished the lead by going straight up the curious poses crack. He thinks the combination is 10b/c. · TR. After Scott finished my lead. Very hard. Still aided moves off ground and then aided the crack straight up. The big column in the middle makes for an awkward #3/2 crack but it works to have r foot in and find features on the left for the left foot, and occasionally bring l foot also into the crack. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on a red metolius towards the top trying to exit the shallow chimney to the thin hands/finger crack. Really hard climb for the grade I think. Start felt WAY harder than 10a, as did the top. · TR. Took the right variation so a lot of odd width and thought it was TOUGH · Lead / Flash. Did the direct finish with the chimney. A couple of hard moves pulling out of the chimney · 4 pitches. Lead / Onsight. W Ceeg; Ran laps after I put the rope up · Lead / Onsight. Absolutely hosed myself with rope drag. Couldn't even be lowered and had to rap. I did onsight it, though! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Gah! Sooooo close to a clean lead. Just one tiny mistake on 3rd crux where I shifted my foot and popped off. Really really close and am bummed about the fall but I’ll remember beta better for next time! Compared to last weekend I styled the 1st and 2nd crux and felt that bumping #3 on upper half of second crux made it easy. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung a couple times at 3rd crux. Figured out technique though and think I could get it clean. Need to remember to extend draws on top half of second crux and then also use draws on 3rd crux to keep rope out of crack and reduce drag. Knobs, slab, and arete are your friend on 3rd crux. TR’d it clean on second go. · Lead / Onsight. Went up the right side of the pillar, then straight up from the ledge. With Leon and Peter · TR. Didn’t finish because the potential fall was rough, need to either lead or have another piece in · Lead / Fell/Hung. Crux is .75 hands as flare rounds. Just power through, it’s short. · Lead / Fell/Hung. fell transitioning in the upper corner, it will go next time. also the upper anchor situation is less than ideal. · Follow. hard crux first move finger lock with bad feet. tough middle section with flaring crack · Lead / Flash. With Ryder and Robin. Funny/scary death block and good crack climbing. Hardest move at start · TR. with Andrea. difficult to protect start and arete finish seemed hecto. fun flaring hand crack in middle · Lead / Flash. Climbed with Danny Matt park and Alana was super fun top part was pretty spicy · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got a absolutely thrashed on this bad boy. The bottom was cruiser but pulling off the cave ledge into the flaring hands of curious poses was super desperate. Whipped on a #2 just below the jug. Fuck. · 2 pitches. Lead. linked with top pitch of curios poses for super fun 10 splitter. Tricky getting into crack off ledge · Follow. Had to cheat a bunch but made it to top. Lots of hand jams and first time at it, hard af and hands bleeding. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead to top of pillar, attempted left finish but ran out of gear and lowered. Aidan cleaned on the way up and aided through. So hot out, still pretty embarrassing · TR. TRS hard start, fell/hung on first move, didn't really figure it out. Sent rest of climb. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to aid some parts because it was wet, hard for the grade. · TR. Felt so hard... will be good to be back to get it some day · Lead / Redpoint. Did right 5.10 chimney variation, climbed it in terrible style, Z clipped but still sent! Stoked"

Struggled off the ledge a bit Good beta to layback the twin crack until the corner has bigger opening · 2 pitches. TR. Mock trad lead. Gotta do it a few more times til I feel comfortable enough. Layback through the first part, gotta limit myself to 3 or 4 pieces next time to avoid getting too pumped. Tried jamming the crack and stemming the upper part, not sure what I like better. Gotta try to save #0.75's and #1's for the upper part next time · Lead / Onsight. Well. I think I got nervous because of the ‘+’ after the grade and went in with a poor mentality. It ended up feeling like a pretty chill 5.7 TBH but I placed SO much gear I got way more tired doing that than actually climbing! It was very clean, the hardest move was getting into the crack one you’re on the ledge. But it was strenuous! I felt like the whole climb was two movement repeated over and over. Overall very fun (: · TR. 1st half tried different beta with Lani's guidance. cruised the 2nd half. Peter on belay · Lead / Onsight. Wooo second ever trad lead! I dropped a cam at the top (luckily didnt fall to ground) and kindaaa ran it out (placed some questionable protection for peace of mind). Spooky bc trad lead but physically easy · Lead / Redpoint. Such a good route! Took doubles to 2\" and only used up to 1. · Lead / Onsight. Very type 1 fun!! Almost forgot to place gear it was so good. · Lead / Redpoint. So good…got back on it for the red point with Kai and Ethan…splitter with amazing rock with tons of texture · Lead / Onsight. Very fun, hardest moves seem to be getting off the ledge · Lead. Took once on gear. Single rack with doubles in blue totem and triples is red and yellow bd if you want to sew it up. I placed minimal draws since it was not much meandery. · 2 pitches. TR. Super fun. Slabby boulder problem, lieback, and then stem. Want to come back and lead this when I have a double rack. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Ran out of gear and lowered back to piece to finish climb, amazing climb takes gear TOO well · Lead. Belay from Markel (WAC). Early fall before my first placement, Markel helped me land safely. A bit hesitant after that, but a clean and energizing lead followed! · Lead / Onsight. Sustained 5.7 climbing to the top. Save small cams for the top bit, a few 2-3 for the last bit as well · Lead / Onsight. Stellar. All the gear is there up to 2. Could put 4 at top but unecessary · Lead / Fell/Hung. Legs were jello from doing north twin day before. Burned all 1s down low and ran out of gear 10’ from top. I’ll be back · Lead / Fell/Hung. First redpoint on trad. Still learning crack climbing, and gear management. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Laust led on his own! Then Luis. Then I followed, only placed a few pieces, fun layback moves, pumpy, hand jams. · Lead / Fell/Hung. First lead of the day and it felt hard to me. Persevered with a lot of takes. But then I top roped it and I flew up it. Never felt like I was going to fall. Want to lead it again · Lead. So enjoyable I almost forgot to place pro. Single rack 0.4–2 and doubles 0.5-1 should be enough and extra safe. · 4 pitches. Lead. 2x .5, .4, 3x #1, .3 W Wade JV AM CG Nbrune · Lead / Redpoint. Slipped on the first ten feet like an idiot and decked, then clean second attempt · TR. So nice so chill, easy lie back and then the nicest hand crack of my life, smooth and fast the whole way · Lead / Redpoint. Led this twice today. First time was kind of chaotic, felt scared and unsure. Second time I sent it, one of my best leads yet. Climbed above all my pieces! Bouldery and scary start. The layback is solid and takes .75s, then around the corner is mostly 1s. Such a great climb · Lead / Flash. Nice climb. Some corner, some layback, some hand jams. With sarah. She led first. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took once, route eats up 0.5/0.75's. Was a challenge to lead it with just doubles (got creative with nuts the 2nd half) · Lead / Onsight. Felt like a senior citizen climbing this. Cool climb. The sunset summit was stunning. Brought up Jonah to look at the view then we lost the rope and had to jump off the top of the climb. All good though hitting the jack rn"

The arete crux, move onto left face. smear. some okay holds next to bolt, at bolt move right top part is smearing high right feet with sloper hands. clipping is easier higher up often times. · Follow. One fall on the left side of the arete, 3-4 bolts from the top · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at two places about 2/3 up. Moreso a head crux then physical with the Arete for me. · TR. Fell a bunch at the crux but other than that I surprised myself with how good it felt! May have had a little help from Carly belaying · TR. One or two hangs at the crux. Great hard friction slab practice, would love to come back and try and lead sometime. Id be prouder to send this than rainy day lol · Lead / Fell/Hung. Not really an 11a (much harder), might deserve a pg13 due to the rope dragging on the corner in some fall zones, imo not worth the send unless everything else is taken. The first jug above bolt one is hollow and will probably pull off after another season or 2. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Chuffing at the 3rd bolt… took a ton of falls all over this thing it’s super safe · TR. Sooo close to a clean TR. Gave it two burns today. First one was re-figuring the beta and the second I nearly sent it. Crux 1 - left hand on the chip, lean hard right to get fingers on tiny chip, work feet up and get right foot on the tiny chip. Crux 2 - feet on tiny left cracks. Left foot on upper crack. Paste right foot on tiny divot with both hands on the rail. Work hand up rail. Work left foot back in to move right foot high one more time. Farther right is better for right foot. Then able to reach up with left hand to pinch the overlap. · TR. Many takes but figured out all the beta. The crux was working left of arete on tiny feet then friction walking up the spine to a somewhat desperate move to a thin crimp (that maybe flexed?). Would feel good about trying on lead with pre-hung draws. Maybe an extended one at the crux. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Couldn’t sort out the friction moves from bolt 6-7, but did the rest · TR. Climbed this route with one hang. Really fun, slabby and insecure with a few good crimps along the way · TR. Fell a number of times. Still feels very difficult and cryptic, especially towards the top of the arete before the mini roof thing. Neither Theresa nor i could figure out how to cleanly send that one. Going the the left side of the arete seemed to work for a bit around there (versus the other side for the majority of the climb) but rocking back around was mystifying. Lots of compression, lots of try hard. Heel and toe hooks on the arete rail were decently effective. · Lead. 2 attempts with plenty of falls at mid crux. Move left when exiting next rp attempt · TR. Attempted, got to hold less part of arete and couldn’t make much progress. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Cerebral slabby arete climbing! V fun. Went left at middle crux · TR. Oh PLEASE!!!! Did ONE move, pulled through the rest. I wonder if a grasshopper grip strategy would work hahahaha · TR. TR, better than a while ago, but still slipped a bunch. Good to go left at the main crux · Lead / Fell/Hung. Sweet. Come back with good conditions and maybe prehang the draws. Free’d all the moves. Go left below mini roof then back right · TR. tipped over backwards in frog step once, followed good crimps left but was a trap. last 8-10 ft before overlap (mini roof) in the middle was the crux, just terrible feet and steeper, slipped a couple times there. not really any defined beta, the dishes are non-existent and the biggest feature for feet is a slippery quartzite knob that's best to avoid. stayed right of arete up high for a few bolts · TR. directionals for TR a must, at least every 2-3 bolts in middle and all of last 3. did better but still slipped at crux twice. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got most of the moves down. Slipped transitioning from right side back to the left face at the top where it gets steeper · TR. was able to do eventuall work out all the moves in unideal conditions. crux still fept too hard to consider leading. major major progress from last time. · TR. loved it! hugging the arete, smearing and small crimps made this very enjoyable · Lead / Fell/Hung. Couple falls at crux (and at the easier section above). Could've climbed better, but glad I tried it on lead. · Lead / Fell/Hung. few hangs in middle third before roof feature. super rad but so so nails. · TR. with Andrea. fun did all the moves would be scary lead. moved to left side at crux overlap. seems like a 4 star route · TR. felt hard, will use softer shoes next time. A lot of fun though! · TR. Top roped this guy after senior citizens and I quite enjoyed it. Fun slab movement. Couldn’t get the one move at the end of the spine before working onto the right side. Everything else felt pretty straightforward with a good amount of friction feet · TR. Haley and max TRd by moving over from senior citizens. Had some takes but made it to the top. There are some face features not to miss in bottom 2/3rds, move left before roofish section-crux. · Follow. couldn't get the crux, 50pct of the time I get it every time · TR. Fell twice at crux on TR before figuring out beta (move to the left side of the arete). Super fun and stout (definitely go when it's cold)! · TR. One slip and then hung to figure out crux. Was trying to go right instead of left."

Gear was utter garbage after the first move (which was fun, and easy to protect). Brief groundfall run-out after that, then two okay nuts at the base of the ramp. Pro after that is in shaky, hollow flakes. Best not to place any."

Climbed with Kat - my fingers and mind wanted to jam the upper part ow but my body wouldn't fit:( Ended up lie backing which felt committing because you'd poke your head in to see the next placement and it would be like three feet into the crack hah just had to keep going to the chains. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Haley lead. Felt proud of myself for getting on this one. The pro is great. I struggled so hard at the chimney though. I had to aid up to get through the bottom half of it. I was trying to go right side in, but max went left side in and said that works much better. Would love to try this one again. Max TRd as it was getting too hot. · TR. Pretty fun but burly at the top! Wouldn't necessarily want to lead it anytime soon lol · TR. Start was cruisy but I fell trying to get up the off-width. I tried to stay in the off-width part in case I wanted to lead it but between being bad at off-width, using the finger crack within the off-width and getting my knees scraped up with the lack of long pants, I ended up having to layback it. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Not sure how this is 5.9+. I guess saying goes that 9+ is always harder than 10a. Felt significantly harder than Japanese gardens(first anchor), Gm route, Godzilla and battered sandwhich. Went right side in, maybe will try left side in next time · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lots of dirt off the bat and just way too wiped from the sun to finish the layback. Fell at the top · Lead / Fell/Hung. Scariest 5.9 for me so far...I didn't have a #4 so I had to run out in the middle section, which was not too bad. But the top section really got me. It felt so awkward for my finger to work in the deep crack so finally I took a few rests on #0.75 and #1 to regain the confidence to finish it · Lead. This climb is fucked. Lol. Super dirty crack in the first half, straight up muddy hand jams. Gear was not the most confidence inspiring. The squeeze also just didn’t go down for me. Pulled on and hung on some cams · Lead / Fell/Hung. Left side in the crack & face out at the top. Felt very burly! · Lead / Flash. super very nice oui oui. couple weird pro spots with a lip that blocks a bigger can from entering into an inward flare. but stellar all the same · Lead / Onsight. Save a #3 for the top. Lie back the whole thing · Lead / Onsight. fun but burley for me! the offwidth ish at the top took a lot of my shoulder skin · Lead / Onsight. With Taylor, pretty fun! Climbed the wide part as an offwidth and was hard, bottom part really good · Lead / Onsight. Fun route. Super mixed climbing. Fun jamming and lay backing. Crux just last horizontal getting into and up the ow. Nice to have doubles .5-3 and a 4. Placed a yellow offset low that was nice too. Left side in at top worked ok. Wear pants · TR. Still fucking hard. Lay back the top part was okay but hard and slick. Worked at the top. · TR. Lindsey/Erik put the rope up, trone hung until the offwidth and then got a little fucked up · Lead / Fell/Hung. The bottom half was awesome! Jammed & laybacked, and great gear. I couldn’t figure out the top part! It was like an off width but too wide for my feet to heel toe, and too narrow to use my knees. Ended up aiding that section as it started to rain and I had been there for a while already barely moving upward. Very cool climb! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took a couple times in OW. Yarded on gear once or twice but otherwise made all the moves. Left side in, jam with left hand, use rf to scooch upwards · Lead / Flash. Double rack to 3. Save a 0.75 and a 1 for the top · Lead. Hung twice before the offwidth and then many times in the offwidth. Try left side in next time. Was happy to double up on 4s. · TR. Left side in is, in fact, a bit easier. Use right leg against slab wall and push up. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Note to self: don’t do that as a warm up when it’s your first climb of the season and it’s also 30C and in the sun · Lead / Fell/Hung. Did not layback the top and got real awkward. Needs some traffic- muddy · Lead / Onsight. Really fun! Ran through all size and had to work in the offwidth · Lead / Fell/Hung. Get in better shape! Took a lot. Top is definitely the crux. · Lead / Flash. 5.9++. maybe laybacking the top section would have been easier climbing, but harder to place gear. proudest and hardest trad lead to date · TR. Wet dream of a masochist. The off-width at the top was painfully hard. Unique route, but felt very hard for the grade. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Tag teamed with partner climbing a little, lowering, then attempting again, cam by cam, until completing route. · Lead. Didn’t get clean. Come re-do to practice wide crack technique. Fun tho! Try laybacking next time? · Lead / Fell/Hung. Would bring three 3s again , brought 2 4s and placed both but one would be fine. Pulled on gear at top crux, need to get left hand high, right arete compression/gaston move left foot up. Right foot is useless. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Aided through the chimney section. Lots of 1-3, found place for 2 4s. Small gear (.5-.75) in chimney. .75-1 above. Bottom part was fun. Mix of crack + lie back. · TR. Fell a couple times trying stuff out. Was able to make upward progress on the chimney facing out, left hand in the crack. First few moves were really hard but then it became much easier. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Challenging overhanging hand to fist crack. Couldn’t figure out the offwidth moves and ended up laybacking the last 10ft Don’t climb this on a 90 degree sunny summer afternoon… · TR. with Andrea. super fun squeeze like climbing. not sure if I did this before with kaiulani · Lead / Redpoint. 3x 0.75\u0003, 2x#1&2, 1x#4, blue totem, purp bd offset nut. Left side in upper, still awkward, maybe slightly better for gear but chimney felt insecure but more offwidth than chimney. prob better! · Lead / Fell/Hung. offwidth at the top was really hard trying to get in the crack but popped out · Lead / Onsight. Warm up for the day. Fun climbing with good a nice crack. Crux was up top navigating the hips and shoulders while trying to stay in the crack and not come out and lay back it · Lead / Onsight. Flare was very strenuous with back to wall and trying to jam off fingers. But was able to tall person stretch to victory · Lead / Fell/Hung. Used 2x 0.75-#3, single 0.3-0.5 & #4. Didn't bring nuts but a few spots for them. Took whip on 4 layback, blew left foot leaning in to grab jug. Groveled Rside in flare, wear shitty shoes. Try back against the wall or layback upper section. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Cruiser until the wide section near the top, flailed so hard. Tried to jam the .75 crack right side in. Maybe need better beta, maybe just suck at wide. Will try again · Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Matt park Alana and Danny it was quite fun gear was shit tho · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hang dogged it pretty hard on the chimney section before committing to the layback. Fun down low · TR. beta from Bill and Juliet: try looking outwards and chimneying the OW at the top · Lead / Onsight. Got a lil gripped at the layback. Wasn't that bad, still clenchy though. Good gear"

Used the #4 but not the #5 · Lead / Onsight. Didn’t use a 5. But two #4s would have been nice. It was easy so I ran it out. Single rack up to 4 enough. · TR. Mock trad lead.

Hard wide crack sections, feel like I mostly worked around the actual crack climbing. Did get a butterfly stack and one heel toe cam · Lead / Onsight.

Can bump a #4 for the upper crack, but take care as it's pretty tight. · Follow. Super fun TR! Small finger laybacking on super grippy rock (truly a harder senior citizens) up to a perfect fist crack corner. Placing tricky gear in the layback will be the leader’s crux. · Follow. Fell right where the crack disappears on the right corner. Next time, left foot on the foot hold, bump right foot as high as possible, crimp with left hand and reach up until fingers fit in the finger crack. Cruisy except for the crux. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 hang going into the tips section, mental got really weak. save a .3 or black totem for the weird crack up high. · Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Martin - in the short list with my favorite 5.9 at Index. Super fun! Save a #2 or #3 for the top · TR. Really good climb. Just wish there wasn’t seeping green goo half way up. · Lead / Flash. pro kinda gets real weird on this thing, but the movement is great! also my follower slipped off near the big block that sticks out and almost banged his head into it real hard. · Lead / Onsight. Somewhat tricky gear,black totem and #3 is nice for the top. Nuts useful · stuck to the crack the whole way, bit of a crux in the middle where the crack gets thin and it's a reach to the finger lock, not sure about leading, seems to protect but can't sew it up · TR. never really hard but I feel stretched out and never really comfortable, might be a stressful lead · Lead / Onsight. 5.9, only at Index. big nuts or maybe a passive cam placement in upper part of corner. Save a #3 for bumping in the corner after the ledge, #4 was tiiiight, maybe a 3.5 if you got 'em. tiny stuff too · Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Zack Novak. Seep was real in crack. Did face variation. Used single 3 and 4 up top. Stiff for the grade. Quality route. · TR. The description for this route reads, \"similar to Senior Citizens but a bit harder\" and would like to add that I think this is a much stiffer/harder route. I noticed some really thin fingers halfway up. · Lead. Fell after 2nd slab bolt. Much harder when it’s wet and dirty, which it currently is! · TR. Brutal, I pulled gear, stood on bolts and almost barfed but supper fun · Lead / Redpoint. Clean lead! Needed small AND big pro. Little guys for middle section, 3” and 4” would be great up top. Gear was tricky. · Lead / Onsight. Wet in the middle Face bypass was wet as well but climbable. · Lead / Onsight. Super fun. Crux looks worse than it is, but still a bit tricky (AL) · Lead / Flash. Brought doubles 0.3-3 and single #4, placed #4 near start, used a large nut too (important). Some smaller gear in mide (some 0.3), then onto face slab for a second, then nut and up the crack and place optional #3 at end of that crack before mantling, then finally ends with a #3 wide corner crack that was tiring (bump the #3 up the whole way). Pretty good route, varied! Only used like 6-7 pieces. · Follow. good but not sure how I would protect the upper dual cracks, wet ad well. great climb but not as much as some of the others. · TR. TR'd from Moai, was a bit damp, did slab variation, gear might not be super straightforward but fun to TR"

Layback + left foot smear + right foot rand smear for the first leaning crack. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at the slab part just past the second bolt. I didn't trust my feet enough and the second the crack was barely in reach, I went for it and promptly fell off. Thankfully, no cheese grater. Second time, I was more confident with the feet and put my left foot in the small hole on the crack line and trusted it and it went. Also didn't help that my shoe was covered in dirt and twigs because I stepped on red cherry-flavoured candy (I could smell the artificial cherry). Probably lost some traction because of that. · Follow. Highly recommend rappelling the route instead of lowering, saw a nasty swing and slam over the edge today. If you need to clean/follow/TR/etc use redirects or anchor the belayer and tether into their strand. A 60m will reach the lower trail (climbers left) on rappel but make sure to tie knots. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on initial lie back and getting into hand crack (wet feet slipped) · Lead / Pinkpoint. James lead first up. Added a lot more pieces in addition to ones he placed. Chill 5.8 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Take down low to sort out the feet. Smearing was the answer. · Lead / Onsight. fun movement, definitely lower fall line and avoid the swing potential · TR. crux at start takes a good .75, the upper 3 crack is kind of shallow for hands but the cam was ok. · Lead. Fun climb! Lower is kind of a PITA. Doubles 0.5-2 was plenty, could place more if you so desired though. Jim took a swing on the lower, found best way was to trolley down, lower slowly at bottom, go off belay and clean first bolt at ledge, then down climb to ground. · TR. First move was really hard slab, the rest was really enjoyable crack climbing · Lead / Onsight. Life direct is like the most honest 5.9 at index, a one move slab wonder · Lead / Onsight. Did direct start (under first bolt), \"Life, Direct\" 5.9 in book. · Started this but really wasn’t into the weird 0.5 layback that is throwing you off the rock.

Follow this splitter as it widens to hands and goes to the top. The rock is really grippy and the angle is fairly low, so it may make for excellent practice at finger-to-hand jamming for the new trad climber. Old trad climbers like it too.As others have pointed out, this is easily linked with a pitch below. But if you have the time, belay at Buzz's where you can more easily watch your partner enjoy the jams.A little story about the name. On our last walk together in her old neighborhood, my mom and I got into counting dandelions in the yards we passed. Her counting was very slow, but that was fine with me as the number of dandelions were low, typically 10 or less per yard. Yet there was this one yard at the corner that I thought we should avoid, seeing as it appeared to have thousands. Somehow though, we did get to that yard, and we did start counting. As the numbers climbed, I started to feel a bit anxious. And then, a miracle: once my mom hit 24, she just said \"Well, I suppose there are more than 24 there.\"",

At the top, follow the trail straight back north that soon bends right. In about 20 paces, a side-trail branches off right and stays near the top of Planet Index. Follow to the obvious top to Lookout jr.2) Near the base of the above gully, and below Daddy Wall, go right on the trail along the base of The Towers. Follow the sometimes faint trail up the hillside just east of Planet Index. When you are level with the top of Lookout jr, cut left, directly over to the top.

Lots of different moves, good views. Total absolute pain to hike to the crag tho. Be prepared for what feels like 1000 feet of straight up. It’s and index 5.7 but feels like a Squamish 5.8. Again, a neat spot. · Follow. Has a tricky start with a bulge but a good hand jam does exist to the left deeper in the crack. The 2nd half also was a bit thin, making thr feet not as secure · Lead / Onsight. Linked w milkman. Most finger sizes, only needed 1 #2-3. Super fun, crux is the broken bottom section, the upper splitter is a lovely pitter patter. · TR. Climbed this after Milky Man. First half is sporty and beautiful crack in second half · Lead / Flash. Lead after OM with Nick following. Enjoyed starting in the corner left of the anchor. Fun low angle splitter. · TR. Double team climbed this with Stockton. Seemed a fair bit harder than the 7s at Private Idaho, especially the slab party of Milkman, and getting into a crack on this one. · Follow. Followed ben on this, led 1st pitch. One Bouldery move otherwise fine would lead · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung on upper crack. Tired from day and previous day run. · Lead / Onsight. Led this twice, but the first time cut left halfway up and finished on the cracks that end the 10c sport route. · TR. Would be OK to lead. Top thin crack is the crux but was OK 1 foot and then some small features for right foot. · Follow. Amazing link up with Oyaji Milkman…super fun and the views from top incredible. You can go all the way up to the top and rap down or take hand lines up from Private Idaho area to get to the start of Oyaji · Follow. Patrick led. Seems to be the 2nd pitch of Oyaji? First move off the semi-hanging belay is very precarious. · Follow. Did as 2 pitches with Oyaji Milkman Loves the Sea. W/ Evan and Trudy · Lead / Onsight. fun little splitter, I had trouble with getting perfect finger locks at the beginning with my thinking fingers however the terrain is great both inside and out the crack. the crack (1/3rd the way up) does have a lip towards the outside so it may look thinner than it is for gear so keep in mind."

I feel like I should have laybacked this and it would have been a lot easier but I was trying to crack climb it? ….and I’m not very good at leaning cracks so it was kinda awkward. it was fine but I didn’t feel the hype. · TR. Squamish 10a for sure. Reminds me a little bit of the slab cracks by Shannon falls. Beta is to have your feet in the crack and slowly inch up. Pretty nerve racking even on toprope. Kyle hung on almost every peice. There’s some very trustful slab steps you gotta do. Need a good lead head for this one. It’s a beautiful crag though. · Lead / Onsight. It was difficult for me to trust the slab portion but I got past it with some shakey legs. I stayed in the crack on the obvious layback for practice which was fun but strenuous. overall great climbing. Can be combined with 24 dandelions with a 70m · Lead. Yet another variation, this time moving right instead of clipping the bolt. With Sam. Approach (this time): moved right/east of the towers towards the gully, then followed the handlines up to the base of Lookout Jr. · Lead. Actually pitch 1 that leads to 24 dandelions. Starts easy, then some interesting well protected Slab moves, then a pumpier somewhat challenging small crack lay back. Glad it protected well. · Lead / Onsight. Skirted right at the first ledge, clipping the lower bolt right, (skipping the 2nd half of the splitter hand crack) to the right crack system to bypass the slabby upper bolt section (milkman direct). Crux was the upper layback section. Linked with dandelions, used doubles in fingers, only needed 1 #2-3. · Follow. Go right around the bolt. Payback crack a bit tricky. Hard for the grade · Lead / Onsight. Awkward beta. Stayed on the right side and jammed the crack, which made hands not secure. · TR. Tried the offwidth variation: switch between right chicken wing and right foot jam. Fun · Lead. Led the offwidth variation. Glad to have brought 2#4 and 2#3. maybe attach quickdraws before placing the cams as they might get out of reach deep in the crack. · TR. Second time is more flowy. For the slab, find tiny ripple, trust the foot and bump up, while pushing with the other foot, you'll be able to stand up. For the low angle slab, stay to the left and layback, slab makes the feet secure. Should be fine placing gear that way. · Lead / Redpoint. Followed clean on first go, then led clean on second go. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung on lead at second bolt. Then climbed clean on follow. · Lead. Climbed with Martin - It has a memorable foot smear as it tries and spits you out to the left · TR. Beautiful area. Great climb. Followed my son and cleaned the route while he belated me from the top. Good anchors! I didn't like the the approach while having to use the ropes. Glad they were there but not in my comfort level. · Lead / Flash. Skipped the slab. Little scary in the crack but great climb! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Jackie belay. This was my first ever crack climb, felt awesome to come back and lead it. · 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Led p1 insecure slab and tough body position second half of the pitch · Follow. With Lani, would lead. Mock led, above ledge followed the left finger crack. Get feet in, not leanback, to feel more secure · Lead / Flash. Fun fun but man do I need to get better at efficient liebacks and protecting them · Lead / Redpoint. SO GOOD. Felt like Squamish. Bottom is a bomber 1-2 hand crack. After that it’s gross slab that has one bolt. I clipped the bolt then lowered down and went up right because fuck slab climbing. Super fun and tricky layback at the top. Very thin, used a blue and yellow metolious. Gets to like .75 at the top. Could use another 2-3 at the top to protect before the anchor. · TR. Slab in middle was crux and may not be fun to lead. Upper crack would be heady but OK to lead. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Forgot the layback beta and was trying to jam and smear in the crack and needed a couple takes. · TR. Fell at the upper crux on the offset hand-crack. Spooky slab felt heady but held well. · Lead / Onsight. Led this one. Found the slabby section protected by a bolt to be mentally the crux. Had a little bit of everything"

        "route_tick_comments": "· Lead / Onsight. Fun; lower parts wet day after rain, upper parts pretty dry · TR. Feels much easier now. Without the slab finish this is easier than Hag Crack. · Lead / Flash. Crux finger crack feels a lot more secure than I expected from below, with solid stances for placements. Save a smaller piece, say .2 - .4 for securing the short undercling slabby traverse right below the bolts. · Lead / Onsight. So good. Looks a lot harder than it is, particularly the last traverse left towards the anchors · TR. Can set a TR from the top of the first pitch of Cloudbeams · Lead / Onsight. Great pitch…especially area around the roof thing…only led to the end of v shaped thing/end of crack then bailed right to bolt · Lead / Flash. Haley lead. I extended almost every piece to reduce drag. It worked pretty well. Finishing chains are to the left. Max tr’d after for ease of cleaning this route. · Lead. Climbed with Martin - I really like this pitch and P2 of Cloudbeams to show visitors who climb in the 5.7-9 range how great Index is. You get great views and very fun climbing. Also by the time I get to the base of Planet Index approach Im like this is just as fun and less hiking lol · Lead / Fell/Hung. Made it to the head point slab at the top. Scott says it’s 5.4 after that but heady. Place doubles .2-3, triples .3-.75 and could have placed more. Watch rope drag. Lay back left crack is the crux but feels quite secure. Slab crack to the right after is also fun and secure. Super fun route will come back and lead. Bring at least much this gear. · TR. Fun climb, the crux on lead is maybe the first leftward crack and rope drag at the end. Zigs left, then right, then left back to the anchor. Last bit of climbing is easy slab undercling trverse on a .2, but with rope drag it'll be a bummer. · Lead / Onsight. First index 5.8. wasn't ready. Almost had a really bad fall · Follow. Lots of lie backing which was simple but a bit tiring. True crux was probably the slab or underling section at the top, but on right top rope it was easy · Lead / Onsight. Really fun route! With Dan. Awesome day. This one had it all: some jams, stemming, lie back, and slab. Took it all the way to the top ledge above first anchors. · TR. Awesome to watch Calvin move through it. Gave it a go for the TR to close out the day, pretty fun sticky slab with a good groove to it. Worth the time. · Lead. Bring a .1 and .2 for sketch slab protection. Double edge sword of “protecting” slab but adding rope drag · Lead / Fell/Hung. Great, long pitch. 1 0.1 and 2 0.2 X4’s were clutch for the slab. A small nut would work well for the final placement. The slab looks more intimidating than it is. No hanging around next time! · Follow. fun! I tried to go up onto the slab midway through the RFC but the slab was very dirty and I think going until the end of the RFC is correct but adds some rope drag · Lead / Onsight. Super fun, bring all small stuff for last bit, was happy to have triples in finger sizes (and .5 or maybe .75). Full 35m · Lead. This was a lot more fun than expected, great jams and some spice at the end. · Lead. Finished Jillian’s bail from the RFC onward. Always more draws including 1-2 doubles · Lead. Climbed with a 69m rope to the Rojo anchors and was able to top rope. spicy moves stepping around to the anchors. · Lead / Flash. Did this once with Adam last year (2022), fun traversy climb with a slightly sketch slab finish · Lead. Never used anything bigger than a #1, was glad to have a lot of .3-.75 . Used a .2, no .1s, bring nuts · Lead / Flash. Super super fun and great views from the top! Doubles 0.2-0.75, single 1,2,3, nuts worked just fine, 1/2 would fit up high if you wanted/needed. Decent 0.2 protects traverse to anchor (undercling makes this pretty easy). Bring lots of slings/draws, 10-12 would not go unused. · Lead / Onsight. Great climb. Got the chance to chat with Jon Nelson on the upper half as he was working on Sastrugi and Cloudbeams · Lead / Fell/Hung. with wren. Took more than needed. Bring lots of .4 and .5's lol · TR. lead the bottom until making the mistake of turning right onto the baron. took a circuitous route to the top, then rapped down to TR the proper route · Lead / Onsight. Really fun climb and will be even better as it cleans up. “RFC” was easier than it looked. 8 slings were not enough! Crux for me was the last bit up and left to the anchors. · TR. first index 5.8. last few moves to anchor were tough. I used a fixed line last 15 feet. great route!"

        "route_description": "A three-pitch moderate route on the far eastern edge of Lookout Point. Fairly non-intimidating (low angle, big holds,  plentiful gear, and easy escapes to nearby gully), so probably a good beginner multipitch experience.The route goes into the shade in the afternoon, so it can be a relatively cool outing on hot days. Also, the first two pitches tend to dry quickly after rain.As it it new, leaders in the first parties on it should probably bring a nut tool to scrape dust & debris out of some placements. Each pitch described below has several possible variations.p1 (5.5): Start with some slightly left-trending face to reach a low-angle ramp at the base of a right-facing corner. Jam, layback, or face climb up this corner, which is the crux of the pitch. The crack bends up left while simultaneously becoming a blocky rib. Enjoy grabbing jug after jug on this section, and practice placing nuts (lots of excellent slots). Stay on the left side of the rib. At the ledge on top of the rib, clip the bolt and traverse up and left on a rail to join a jumble of flakes that become the Jolly Pockets ledge. Belay on the right side, closest to the gully. 60m to 65mp2 (~5.5-5.8): Go up the splitter crack ( ~5.5) then friction right at the bulge. Overcome the bulge on the right side, then trend up and left to an anchor. (For the bulge, if you go all the way to the right, then you are going around it, making it 4th class. But if you go over at the crack, it is harder than 5.5, probably about 5.7 to 5.8.)p3 (~5.5): Not the prettiest pitch, but it gets you to the top. For this pitch, you have to cross a groove-gully of poor-quality rock near the start. But if you go up first on solid, but easy, slab to the roof and then go right, you can essentially step over the bad section on a ramp. (Avoid the temptation to instead go directly right from the belay or you will face the sketchy rock.)  Once on the ramp, you have a choice of two cracks. Both take you to a sloping ledge below a roofy section. Avoid the roofy section (if you want, or take the obvious hand crack through it) by going left to the anchor then up on stacked flakes to a steep ramp going up and right, above the roofy section. There is an anchor just above, but to reach the top, go right and up the ramp to the apex. There is sometimes a handline coming down this ramp.  The belay is just over the apex. The handline takes you to the summit pine forest and flagpole.",

For index this feels much more like a 5.5 or 5.6 than a 5.7. The P2 crack is basically uncessary to ascend the basically walkable slab 15 or so feet below the bulge. The “crux” bulge move on pitch 2 goes very easy with like a couple high foot moves. That said if you’re learning trad leading this one is perhaps even better to practice on than other commonly cited beginner climbs such as Senior Citizens. · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Just p1 from ground start. Evan belay. Length of pitch forced me to learn to run out gear placements. Didn’t use anything larger than a #1, wish I conserved the 0.75 a bit longer. · Lead. Made my own start. So much rope drag so much slab. Nice splitter crack for second pitch and third pitch went up the middle spittle crack that was short but sweet. · 4 pitches. Lead / Flash. w/ Phillip. Led 2 and part of 3. Accidentally did p1 of jolly rando. Crazy amount of drag on p3, so we split it into 2 pitches and pitched out to the top at the flag pole cause why not · Lead / Onsight. Super fun one with Ethan…second pitch is a gem with perfect splitter. Ethan’s first time rapping · Follow. followed lecia’s lead, lead and set up anchor after the last pitch to walk off! · 5 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. top out at flag pole. p3 is the best · 4 pitches. Lead. w/Karen. Broke up long P1 at the intermediate anchor. Led 1st half of P1 and P2 (hung on 4 pieces and lots of rope drag lol). Karen led 2nd half of P1 and P3. 3 raps down to the intermediate anchor and walked down the gully. 70m rope required as we got to the end of it on 2nd rap. · Follow. Led one pitch. First trad lead!! W/ Amanda. Bring water and snacks!! :/ · Lead / Onsight. Led all three pitches and did the 5.7/8 variation on pitch 2. Fun climbing and I had a light rack so ran placements out quite a bit (like 20-30’ in spots LOL) · 2 pitches. Follow. Walk off gulley is to lookers right/skiers left. You can spot that pretty easily as you climb up. Using hand line, down climb to where the yellow arrow is in p4 (below the tree). From there, rappel to lookers right to a flattish ground in the gulley. From there, hike down the steep but obvious trail in gulley. · Lead. Led p 1 super fun. Kate led 2 and 3. Three wasn’t worth it · Lead / Onsight. Pitch 1 and 2 were really fun but I would skip pitch 3 next time. · 1 pitch. Follow. Bad idea to do the first pitch only - bad belay situation. Climbing was easy and chill · Lead. Climbed with Zach. Climbed the right hand crack on P3 this time - it was pretty fun 5.9 or 5.9+ move. · Lead. Did a 5.9 variation on p3 with a bouldery crack problem at the end. Lots of falling. · Lead / Flash. Led pitch 1 and 3; followed pitch 2. Rope drag was pretty bad on pitch 1, so extend where the line turns; crux of pitch 2 comes at gaining the bulge, I put right foot on the slab and pull on a good left fist jam; large portion of pitch 3 was wet and or dirty, be prepared for rope drag. Hiked down on a trail from lookout point, bring approach shoes climbing up. · Follow. Followed Ian up, P3 was pretty dirty. It started raining on us during P3 and made for a not so fun rap out. · Lead / Fell/Hung. did p3 as either JR3 or AB3 - the overhung .75 crack on the right. couldn’t ring lock the crack, felt like a v2 boulder problem maybe (sequence: grab the dagger with the left, gaston on the low jug with the right, left foot in the crack, heel over the right) · Lead / Flash. Multi-pitch trad graduation climb. TR’d the final layback crack (“4th pitch”) that Kelsey led. · Lead / Onsight. Only did P2 and P3. Came from Fallen Stars and then did the off width to finish it off. I led P2, Zach led P3 · Lead / Onsight. Fun speed route with Austin and Jonathan in approach shoes. Finished by going up the hand crack in the middle of the face. · Lead / Flash. With Ellie. Led p2 and did stars and packing slip variations. 3rd pitch was wet and meh. Didn’t extend enough on traverse · 2 pitches. Lead. Started on P2 after Defeat Baron Greenback. Wasn't sure where to go on P3, so went to the chains under Lost Packing Slip and Dan lead that to the summit. · Lead / Onsight. I accidentally started on Defeat Baron, which was buried in dirt and needles and had me pretty gripped. Climbed through pitch 2, but Ben and Matt bailed just below the P1 anchors. · tried the direct roof variation for pitch 3 instead, really hard. did the slab out right, also kinda hard. maybe i wasn't off route the first time after all. · Fun approachable, longish pitches. P1 slightly lose jugs P2 low angle hand-finger crack P3 funk · Lead. Kat lead p1, p3. John p2 Best pitch is p2! Next time I’d just do p1, p2. Pitch 3 ain’t anything · Lead. Climbed with Kat. Thoroughly enjoyed P1 and P2. If I climbed this again would not climb P3. Great views! · Lead / Flash. Led all 3 pitches for Dani’s first multi and first climb at index! Beaut of a day · Lead. led with NP, NP finished on midnight slime bolts at top, would be good to try 5.9 jolly rando crack at top. Bottom sections good for new trad leads. · Follow. Followed devo, great trad mp super splitters on this that I wish ran the whole way. On third pitch, 5.9 fist crack at the top if you stay left near the top. · Lead. Leads: me/Sean/me. A one or two move wonder, good for easy leading, but not particularly great. A traverse section on the second pitch felt scariest (crux move right after felt fine in comparison). Rapped into dirty gully to walk off. · Lead / Onsight. Had a great day out with Vayle! Fun low angle cracks that are engaging to use and some fun moves to get over the bulges. The first crack of pitch 1 and pitch 2 were the best. · Lead. led p 1 and 2 with Honorio from Ev Mounties. Fun second pitch! Pitch 1 too long. · Lead / Fell/Hung. With Kyle. Lead pitch 3. Rather than going to the second set of anchors, use the first set and rap. There is also a second set on the other side of the ledge that could be used to reach the descent trail. I can see this route becoming a good alternative if the GNS is crowded · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Group in front of us was extremely slow. We baled after the at the top of pitch one · Lead / Onsight. Easy fun climbing, if a lik dirty to top out. First route at Index! · Lead / Onsight. lead p1 and 2. p1 was easy and great. end at the right set of anchors. top of p3 was a mess. used the hand line to get thru · Lead / Onsight. The jams on p2 were so fun. P1 longer than expecting, but found the anchors eventually at the base of the p2 crack · Lead. Lead p1 and p3. Very dirty, but fun. I’ll bring my brush next time."

Very clean and grippy rock, somewhat consistent in difficulty throughout, yet with frequent rest stances.One should be confident at 5.8 trad due to the need to place small wired nuts, though probably no move would be considered that difficult. Also helpful, particularly if it hasn't been ascended in months, is to have a nut tool in case some good placements have filled with debris. The bottom groove in particular tends to collect tree debris.The last ~50 feet of this route are likely the old \"easier variation start\" to Bad Reputation.Do a short 5.8 pitch after this one to reach the Jolly P- ledge and access to more low-angle slab routes (e.g., Steel Pulse, Bad Reputation, Jello on the Table).",

Rap from the rightmost anchor, or if you want more friction, continue up easier ground to the belay at the base of Dimples, Pimples, and Pointy Things.This route provides friction slab climbing on the apron without the runouts of Bad Reputation.

Slightly harder is to surmount it on the right edge.

The route follows the old A3 Steel Pulse aid line that goes left where the standard free Steel Pulse goes right.From the low SP anchor, step up left on a large hold to peer into the LF (left-facing) corner and place a piece or two. You can place an excellent small nut at the bottom with an opposition piece and also a black totem a foot higher. The corner jams are fun shallow hands and fingers. Near the end of the crack you can place a few large (~1/2\") stoppers and then clip a low anchor. To here, it is ~10a/b. (You should be able to lower or rap down from here with a 70 m, but we did not check.)Instead, continue up the corner as it turns into an arching overlap that bends left to the Barking Bobcat RF corner. A hard-to-see rail off left helps you to stem up and find ways to grab the super grippy overlap. There are four bolts here, and after reaching the second, you can aid past the crux. After the friction traverse left, you might want to have a small wired stopper before stepping up into the Barking B corner. This corner is nice thin hands and fingers that take you to just below the anchor.To toprope:Toproping can be done without leading a route, though would either require two ropes, a belay from above, or a rap down to the SP/V7M anchor. Reach the top by hiking around the east end and up the gully to the triple cedar tree. Use the access line to safely reach the Joly Pocket ledge and move along the handline west, doing a short ~15' rap on the fixed line to the chained anchor and ledge. Probably easier to just lead it. If you can make it to the second bolt after the mid-anchor, aiding the rest of the crux is easy with an alpine sling as the remaining bolts are very close.",

Cool dry days are best.Pitch 2 (60', 10b): Slab crux near start before and after 1st bolt, 2nd bolt protects slab till you gain left end of small overlap. 2nd crux balance move on short slab below anchor.Pitch 3 (100', 10c): Starts with nice layback cracks, 3 bolts protect upper slab. After passing the 1st bolt (1st crux), there is a hidden pocket- good for a BD #2. There are 2 bolts above here (2nd crux, 10c).

Clean climbing from stance-stance above that. · TR. 2 laps. The first lap was clean. A little effort at the crux but the crack is made for my finger size. The roof pull isn’t bad.

It is so true that dantier fingers find this climb a lot easier. · TR. at crux where there’s a high left foot not far into the crack, get right foot on knob, left foot on downward slope, press right foot into crack, step up. protect with like 5-7 0.3s, bring some 0.4s. for pulling bulge at top, get right foot on ledge and then stem up to get to good high hold and get high foot. · Lead / Redpoint. Triples of .2 and .3 nice to have. Extra .3 to really sew it up. Didn’t place anything larger than .75 · Lead / Redpoint. Today felt great. Came off of Rattletale in front of the group of guides Take your time, keep the heart rate low. Find the rests along the way. Rand jamming is your friend Look for feet on the face: - left at the crux - right above crux Took up: Doubles .3-.75 1x Green, purple, black totem 2x blue, yellow totem Didn’t use: 1x black, yellow totem, maybe .75 Probably could have used another blue totem .75 horizontal piece to protect low, just below the mantle move up to the business .5/.4 to protect before first move Maybe .3 below crux right Pull crux Yellow totem Thin crack between .3/.4 Maybe a blue totem .5 constriction below green Obvious green totem Blue totem in right crack below roof Purple totem higher in offset pocket left Rest Throw roof right hand low, left thumb down hand jam, right pinky down v slot, left up and over to jug on right side of flake You have feet the whole way just look for it to chains Found the flow state. Super present with yourself · Lead / Redpoint. Very sick! My fingers were a bit big for the crux so I laid back the blunt arete to the right of the crack for a couple moves · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 hang after the bulge after sinking my hand into wet - unexpected slip! Great climb!! Will come back · Lead / Fell/Hung. Attempted this for guidebook pics bc Cynthia told Ben I could climb it. lol.

Super fun and would be a cool route to keep going back to as a benchmark for progress. Not a clean lead at alllll. Cruxes are low but still safe, struggled with endurance higher up. Tr’ed a second pass and did way worse after tearing all the skin off my fingers on the first go round · Lead / Fell/Hung. Crux is hard just protect from the stance and gun it!!! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Felt good, just need to be fresh. Save a yellow nut for the mini roof and don’t block the finger pocket with a cam · TR. The TR-onsight! Thanks Keira for leading. Bring five 0.3's and four 0.4's apparently. · TR. Twice, think I could lead this one. Sustained thin fingers. Cruxy entrance into the crack, then good fingers and gear. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell once around the first bulge (right after the juggy lower bit as you’re first getting into the finger crack) where the feet run out and you have strenuous, precise finger work. Curious if pulling the pinky and index finger out for a thumbs up jam would help in some spots. Took quite a few times after that on marginal pieces that were sewn up. Pulling the last bulge roof isn’t as juggy as you’d think, but the beached whale mantle is okay as long as you can still do a pull-up at the end. Triples in 0.2-0.5 would be nice. Bring the small ball nuts and nuts as well plus plenty of draws for nuts. · Lead / Fell/Hung. One fall at crux, reclimbed the crux to the top. Lots of small gear, no real need for anything >1 for first pitch · TR. Was so nice I did it twice. Lead next time, bring triples in .3 - maybe .5 · TR. Fell at the crux repeatedly. Hurt shoulder. Cruz has way harder jams than Iron Horse lol. Maybe morpho with fat fingers and no pinkie… everything other than those 2 moves are pretty easy · Follow. We climbed up a couple more pitches past this one. All the way to the flag at lookout point. · Lead / Onsight. red, small nut, 0.3, 0.4, 0.4, 0.2/0.3, 0.2, 0.5/0.75, 0.5, 0.5/0.4, nuts next time 0.2, 0.3x2, 0.4x2, 0.5x2, 0.75, 1, offset cams, small nuts crux is getting off of ledge into crack. · TR. kelsey flashed it. I did not unsend it. ... first crux, straight in... pinky/ring finger jams. there is no second crux, just sustained until it is not. · Lead / Onsight. Didn’t place as much gear as expected. Took triples of .2 to .3. Doubles .4 to 0.5. One .75 and number 1. · Follow. the ol slender sausages made the follow feel decent. ways away from leading it · Follow. This pitch took a large chunk of skin off Anthony's finger and that was left on the side of the crack for me to clean. This was a stout tips splitter. · TR. w/ Ben after his send! crux feels cruxy, rest feels doable, albeit tiring · Lead / Onsight. Very pleasant climbing up a dihedral w aspect change at start. Not as exciting as slow children, but also no rope cut potential · TR. Fell once or twice at the crux but got the rest clean on TR. · TR. I did really well. Slipped past the lower crux.

At the top, clip your first bolt and move right and up to a ledge. This is the crux move (~10a). Then go up the groove above, clipping only the ratty 1/4\" bolt on the rib (~5.8+).Soon after this route was put up, a variation finish \"Anarchy and Chaos\" was added that goes up the thin crack up and left of the first bolt.In 2012, about five bolts were added to the bottom groove and the large corner continuation of the bottom groove was cleaned out, creating a nice corner variation. Since this occurred, the route suddenly became much more popular.In 2019, the two lower aretes to the right of this pitch and the upper arete to the left were bolted, creating several arete-climbing variations (left: Sleepy Sparrow; right: Sisara). These bolts should not be clipped if doing the original line or corner variation as they would create rope drag and are not needed for protection.Several possibilities exist for climbing further pitches to the top:For a 5.10 finish, take L&O pitch 2 or Ship Called Black Rock, then LOPD p3 to the top.For a 5.9 finish, go right on one of the cracks towards the base of the Black Rock corner, but continue about 10' further right to the corner (7-8).

I've done both variations: The \"Left hand variation\" protects the best, and is a fun layback ending in a 1- bolt traverse back to the right. The \"right hand variation\" uses small pro (brass offset), maybe pg13 and graded maybe 5.9 and a little dirty, could use a bolt, maybe. I like the left variation the best!  The only move on the left hand variation that may feel spooky is a couple face moves getting to the layback, but maybe the face moves are 5.8.  The layback is maybe 10a/5.9 depending where you climb and protects something like this: smaller gear (green or blue basic totem/alien), red basic totem, red basic totem, yellow basic totem/alien. Note about rapping:  It's pretty easy to get down, via different routes or downclimb or tree 2nd rap.  I agree with Jon. Another anchor is NOT needed.  I like the one where it is!  What a fun 40m-45m or maybe 50m long climb! Apr 30, 2016",

Up to where it’s no longer clean, hopped over right to bolted flake. · TR. Heady, unprotectable step left before the lay back crack. Crux is exiting the crack to the right. Slabby feet unlock the sequence. Long route, needs an 80m to belay from ground. · TR. It felt pretty good, the smearing is pretty secure, as is the lieback. I placed gear there and the rests were fine. One to come back and lead. Long runners. Either use bolts or try and find gear up top. Don’t do both. · TR. Really awesome pitch. My favorite pitch this season. Need to lead it next time. · Lead. Might have stopped too early? Built an anchor off bolt and cam where it steps way right to some anchor but wanted it to be TR able for everyone · Lead / Onsight. Next time lead it trad, bolts are in weird spots. Was glad to have a single rack with me. · Lead / Flash. I clipped every goddamn bolt lmao. That pitch would be FUCKED otherwise. But quite fun. Linked this into 4 pitches and topped out the flagpole. Awesome day!! · Lead / Onsight. Bring a lot of draws to clip the many bolts that were put up retroactively in poor style. · Lead / Redpoint. As always, such a good route! Top crack dirty as usual · Scott put up the left variation first pitch and I followed to the anchor for a rap off. Such a unique route. Crux of the left variation is a move back to the main route, it's protected by a bolt. The left layback variation starts at .1 and goes up to maybe .5? Entering the upper third there was a slot that took a 1 or a 2. Take lots of draws, some extras and probably some alpine draws would help with drag and the bolts that are around the arete. · Lead. Ran out of gear to do the top part, no more draws for bolts. · Lead / Flash. Fun route with thought provoking techy movement. Clip the bolts if you want, don’t if you don’t want. Either way great route. Def go left for the layback crack it’s so good. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Ripped my fingers off while trying to clip on crux bolt. Will have to come back and try to lead at some point again · Lead / Fell/Hung. This was probably one of my most FAVORITE climbs at index so far :) would love to do again! Also slightly bolted.one lieback section is so freaking cool · Lead / Flash. Don’t think I went to the proper anchors, traversed to some anchors after the ledge move because rope drag was so bad. · Lead / Onsight. fun climb, takes a lot of quick draws if you clip all in path. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead to the upper crack but it was still seeping. Traversed to tiger Lily but the was soaked too. · Lead / Flash. Brought 12 QuickDraws, clipped 9 bolts, bailed right to lower anchor - ran out of draws. 3-4 more bolts to “normal” finish. · Lead / Onsight. W Jess and maple glad it’s been bolted and the top bolts are sick · Lead / Onsight. Started up Sisara, but then I got scared because I suck at arete climbing so I think I climbed this, but only clipped bolts?? idk. Whatever I did it was fun tho. · Lead. Bailed after the 6th bolt, struggled getting into the leftmost corner and didn’t have a small enough nut to protect well. · TR. Finishes with the shallow groove to the right of the bolted Arete, which is currently filled with dirt, so ended up on Tiger Lily P1 anchor on the big ledge. · Follow. Josh lead Fully bolted Fun! Nice face/corner climbing after a day of off width cracks. 15 draws · Lead / Fell/Hung. sort of got confused by the mess of bolts. didn't bring enough draws · TR. Katie lead right variation, which was fun but mostly limited to the bolts, whole route is trickier than i remember, 35m anchor is a bit out of rach but you could probaby get a .2 in while cleaning · Lead / Redpoint. right variation. should try left, looks like splitter .3/.4-ish, that would avoid the super thin gear in the right variation. · TR. gabe built a bolt + 2x #1 anchor 35M up. super fun, all footwork, could lead now that it's all bolted. · Lead / Onsight. Gear shenanigans unsuccessfully reduced rope drag. Ran out of quick draws. · Follow. followed p2. bolting is off and felt unsafe. surprisingly good friction given how dirty the route was. hard payback crux above the seam. very dirty roof after that. bomb 5.10+ for this pitch. TBD on p1 · Lead. This route seemed hard. Also dirty and lots of rope drag if not careful. Wouldn’t do again · Lead / Onsight. wait, this is a sport climb now? Brought gear so weight training I guess. still used some of it · Follow. Chris Hooper led the first pitch. Well within reach for me to lead. · TR. Need an 80M if you wanna tr this one. Had to pull some shenanigans w/ the 70M. Great route well worth climbing · Lead / Onsight. One of my favorite climbs so far. Awkward corner to start off but it’s bolted. Crux is entering the finger crack section which can be tough to protect (smaller than .3 BD C4). Requires an 80m rope to make it back down. · Lead / Fell/Hung. V slot looks intimidating because it's a little run out but it is way more secure then you think · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on finger crack Fun great view. Have to belay up the second · Lead / Onsight. climbed with colin 1st pitch. rappel in two pitches. move rappel station up and come down left · Lead / Flash. Wet Start, I wouldn't of minded doubles to .5. 2nd Pitch was too wet. · Lead / Fell/Hung. took a hang at a couple spots. no falls. w/ Ben belaying · TR. 3 laps first pitch did the lie back all three times & lowered down to try to dihedral too! stellar!"

The original start is the often seepy Below Lissen, a short pitch up the the base of the white headwall where you belay at a bolted anchor above a large flake. Later, we found that you could instead do the less seepy first pitch of House of the Seventh Bobcat, then traverse left into the vertical crack of p2.Pitch 2 traverses right (5.10) to a short, nearly vertical crack that bends right and stops at the top (5.9). Reach from the top of the crack over to the corner crack at right and then head straight up towards the looming chimney above. Climb the chimney and belay on top at a bolted anchor. If it is very hot, you can drop down into the \"rat hole\" behind the flake for cooler shade.Pitch 3 goes directly up from the belay along a crack system that becomes a right-facing corner. Follow this hands-and-finger crack in the RFC as it curves right and ends. Be sure to use long slings on this section as you must turn the corner past the roof and layback up a rounded edge (5.11a), forcing the rope to go over the roof. Belay above on the sloping ledge.If you want to top out, do a short pitch up through the trees to a belay at a final headwall. Climb the face past a bolt, trend left below a bulge to reach a short RFC with some finger jams to an awkward mantle. You can clip a bolt just below this crux RFC and also clip a bolt just after mantling.

It starts to the left of TL on the same start of Law & Order, clipping that route's first bolt before trending right. Then about 30' after passing over the overlap (the crux overlap of pitch one of TL), it crosses TL heading right, and briefly joins the old Dukes of Stratosphere at a rightward undercling with a new protection bolt.Above, the route stays in the right groove-corner passing two more bolts before reaching \"Dukes Ledge\" and an anchor.The crux is probably the moves soon after the Dukes undercling where the crack peters out. That part of Dukes is listed as \"5.9\" in the old topos, but we think others would rate it 5.9+. The ledge above, \"Duke's Ledge\", is large and comfy with a chained anchor. From here, you can take the ramp right to join the belay at the last pitch of Steel Pulse. If instead you go left off Duke's, you join Tiger Lily, and if you go straight up the face, you are on Dukes of Stratosphere.",

Where you get to the upper groove, switch to the steep fin and layback in the other direction to the top. Whereas the bottom arete is more technical, the top fin is more pumpy.The rope tends to snake along the rock and create a bit more than the average drag near the top. So, some longer draws near the start and transition left, as well as using a slicker (newer) or smaller-diameter rope might help you at the top.  Another way to have less rope drag is to do a variation called The Sleepy Sparrow, which goes to the left arete from about the 6th to 7th bolt, then directly up to the upper fin.* She is such a radical android",

Listed here are probably the easiest for most parties.p1: Start on a series of steps going up a ramp. The steps stop, but there is a good layback edge on the right wall to make it easy for you to walk your feet up the ramp. At the top of the ramp is a short bulge with two cracks. Take the crack on the right. This bulge, and the crack just above it, is the crux  I thought that stemming around it kept the difficulty at 5.7, though others think it is an 8 or 9 (and may do it differently). The cracks both trend towards a wide crack. Upon reaching the wide crack, cut back right towards the big ledge. Ends at a ledge with rap anchor about 40' below the level of Law & Order ledge.p2: Go straight up the thin crack that improves. A short ways up join \"Dukes ledge\", then trend left, then back right following the main crack. Ends at another big ledge. Probably 5.9.p3: Continue up the corner system to a bulge. Go right around the bulge (5.9 awkward, though solid jams) and up, trending left to a large ledge system above other routes. At the crux bulge, place gear carefully to reduce chances of a ledge fall.If you wish to top out (highly recommended), continue up to the wooded ledge and belay here, if rope drag permits. This pitch is probably the crux.Topping out: TakeLOPD p4 up the face past four bolts and gear to a treed ledge right below the flagpole. This pitch meanders a little, so use long slings on some pieces. From here, you can walk around or select from a few very short pitches directly up to the flagpole (more fun this way).Along the way, there are numerous opportunities to connect up with other routes including Dukes, Steel Pulse, Law & Order, Black Rock, as well as numerous variations.",

Did the third pitch of Tiger Lily while Miller did the worse Dukes P3. Super cool steep section with decent holds to a tight hands crack. · TR. I moved the anchor while lowering from leopard. I was looking at gear on TR and slipped a bit into the initial slab section. First piece of gear was solid, but the finger flake is a little on the thin side and a bit flaring, wasn't stoked about the piece I tested around where I fell · Lead. Lead p1 and p3, Jared p2.

Went left at the end of pitch 3 to a bolted anchor that had a fixed line. Rope has a tendency to get caught in rappels on this route. Start of pitch 1 and 2 were spicy · 1 pitch. Lead. First pitch only, loved the climbing. Stemming beta made the move over the bulge pretty easy · 1 pitch. TR. laybacked to get through the bulge then went right to the anchors. very fun · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. lead first two pitches but like not really bc i used the static line a lot bc it was so scary and hard · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. led first pitch no falls, some tricky spots, small gear at start. second pitch also has a tricky start with little gear, layback on small holds and mediocre feet. essentially did the second pitch no falls, could have gone to the anchors but instead tried the finger crack to the left, it's all ring locks. I fell there. didn't have time for 3rd pitch · Lead / Onsight. Really good upper pitches, could use more traffic and love to make the cracks sparkling clean and free of needles/dirt. P3 was the crux · 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Did the first two pitches and didn’t have time to finish it. Need to come back, the climb was great. Love the roof on the first pitch · Lead / Onsight. fun moderate climbing with great pro the entire way. mostly 5.7 climbing with some harder cruxes"

        "route_description": "The real \"Bowling\" is the second pitch of this route, and at the time it was put up, was far and away the best crack at Lookout Point. I'd still put it in the top five. The first pitch is just the approach pitch, so if you only do that, well, good, but don't rate the whole climb on its account.P1: 5.10a. Climb a short crack on a pedestal, about 30' left of Peanuts. At the top of the pedestal, layback up and right to the face holds (takes a good wired stopper or brass nut: #5 BD nut is perfect). The face climbing (~5.8) has two bolts, and ends on a ledge below a hand-crack in a shallow corner. Climb the crack (~10a) and do a few traverse moves left to a two-bolt chained anchor below the roof.Older guidebooks erroneously showed the flaring corner just below p2 as the first pitch. Now that corner is clean, so it makes an alternative first pitch (in summer and fall, anyway--it tends to stay wet in winter & spring). Some folks now start on it, then veer right about 20' up to join the standard p1 described above.P2: 5.10d. Go over the roof on the right side, grabbing solid flakes and jamming (~10a). Enter the corner (see photo) and follow the corner to a ledge and 3-bolt belay. The crux is the pumpy jams soon after pulling the roof. The crack widens at the top. The top ledge is very comfortable. This second pitch stays clean, and has slightly curvy and colorful rock. Sustained corner jamming. It also tends to be drier than nearby routes, even in a light rain.A double rope (150') reaches the ground. With a single rope, you can rap to the anchor at the top of the first pitch, but it may require a little swinging to be able to grab the chains. From this anchor, a single 60-m rope will reach the ground.",

So, for us the rating was 5.10 C2.More recently, much better climbers have freed the line, at likely 5.13++. It is still a blast though to aid the start just to hang inverted on bomber hand jams and throw for solid knee hook over a jutting edge.

First one was hard finger crack, definitely didn’t totally nail it. · Lead first and third, followed Kevin on rest. Did every move free but definitely hung.

Good morning session despite vertigo and sadness. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell once on the slab down low by the anchors then had some falls on the last face section.

Triples 0.5's and 0.4's very useful for P2. Undercling layback felt harder than anything on Return to Easter Island. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led most of p1 for velvet pedestal and led p1 of this. Had two takes. One for figuring out the start move. One for a rest mid dihedral. · Lead / Fell/Hung. w Mikey. Sent first pitch, took a break on second pitch because my back was sore (30s amirite). Brought triple rack and x4 of .5 and .75, and actually used 4 of the .75 on the first pitch Took 2 hrs 40 min for 2 pitches of climbing. · Lead / Onsight. Really nice climb. 1st pitch is definitely the money pitch. Approach pitch on velvet probably had the hardest moves. · 4 pitches. Lead. Lead the ones I didn’t last time, and an extra mystery pitch? · Lead / Onsight. Really fun route. Pretty chill overall with a couple spots to pull harder. Gear singles small to 3, doubles .3-1, triples .3-.5, slings, no nuts. · Lead. As usual, a super classic in the making! Climbed with Rebecca for her first route on Lookout and since Hanky’s accident. · Lead / Flash. Lead the first pitch and followed the 2nd. Such a good route!! · 4 pitches. Lead. Approach gully and corner to bolted anchor. Then short stout corner. Then p1/2. Crack gloves and doubles .3-3 with a 4 and some nuts · Lead / Fell/Hung. w/ Keira. Led pitch 1. Boulder move was hard for someone who is short. Wished I had atleast four or five 0.75's. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Super fun! Definitely want to do again. There is a tricky part -weird diagonal lieback maybe? Bring 3x 0.5s and 3x .75. Was a little heady without. · Lead. Led P1, 3/4 of 0.5 and 0.75s is the way to go. Tree stem off start of P1 is good. Bring a 4 if going all the way up the crack on P1 instead of cutting off left early. · Lead. Ladies aid day with anelaya and Olivia! Anelaya and Olivia’s first cam aid pitches. · 3 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. With Daniel, lead P1 and P3. Did not get cute and fall on the last pitch this time. · 3 pitches. Lead / Flash. Lead pitches 1 and 3, jeff lead pitch 2, fun climb. Went right at the end of VP pitch 1 · Lead. KB led p1 of VP and I led P1 of SW and she led P2. P1 of Say when eats gear- happy to have extra in .5/.4 and having .4 is helpful for final layback pitch Kelsey led. · 1 pitch. TR. TR P1 from the same anchor we used for And Say (in-between the climbs) · Lead. w/Anna and Chad I lead P1 of VP, Chad lead P1 of Say When. · Lead / Onsight. P1 w/ Adam and Shannon. For Index’s “best 5.9” this kinda sucked. Could get my hands deep enough for solid jams on the upper half. Most of the climb wasn’t good enough for hands. Was popped by then and didn’t do the second pitch. Looked better than P1 tbh Gear: 2x .4-1 maybe a #2/3 next would help. · 3 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Swap with Garrett. I lead P1 (And Say first pitch + short crack off the ledge) and P3. Super fun, maybe my favorite 5.9 I've done at Index. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led pitch one. Great climb. You could easily make use of 4 .5’s and .75s, pitch one is very consistent. Pitch 2 felt like the crux, but not that much harder. Awesome .4 protects the move from the corner to the arete. · Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Zach. Gorgeous views and awesome climbing. Just a great way to end our day at Index. · Don’t bring nuts. But a double rack was handy. Did bring a red alien Plus two .5 · Lead / Onsight. Follow approach pitch, onsight p1. Great corner climbing. Maybe a 3rd .75 would be nice but not necessary. · Lead / Fell/Hung. P1-Velvet Pedestal, P2- TASH, P3-Say When. Got 'cute' trying to avoid liebacking and fell. · 3 pitches. Follow. First pitch up the chimney by the static line was DIRTY. We used it to climb up that pitch. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell once each before each layback section. Could 1000% redpoint just got scared with my new belayer Baz. Awesome route. · Lead / Redpoint. Why did we just party of four up this… *bong*… awesome day. Second trad multi pitch leading all the pitches! · 3 pitches. Lead. grungy approach pitch to some stellar crack climbing. great laybacking, ring locks, and jams · Lead / Flash. Brought doubles 0.3-3 and 9 single alpine draws, that was about perfect. Didn't use any nuts. Entry pitch of Velvet Pedistal was the toughest and dirty. This climb has some pretty neat laybacks. Rap route with 70m, good raps, each pitch is near full length. · Follow. Oh my gosh this was so fun. I want to lead it ASAP. This goes so hard. Remember to put a .3 and bust the step right move on p2. · Lead / Onsight. W Anthony. Led p1 of Velvet Pedestal and P2 of this. · 4 pitches. Lead. Rapped to do it again! Lead and followed each pitch once. two variations on pitch 1 · 3 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Swung leads w Robby,I lead pitch 2 and the alternate variation pitch 3. AWESOME! · Entry pitches may seem out of character. Keep going and your mind will be blown ! · Lead / Onsight. Really good - climbed with Derek- late tick so don’t remember details"

After an intermediate chained anchor (~50 ft up; do not belay here), you soon arrive at a wide platform known as \"Rojo\". From Rojo, you have two choices, both nice and clean cracks going to the same ledge 30' above, and both about 5.9.  a) On the left side, a right-leaning offset hand-to-finger crack. b) On the right side, a finger-crack and layback that first trends right, then left.  Both end on a sloping ledge with a chained belay anchor.P2: 10a. Go left to the tree. Then start this pitch one of two ways. 1) Traverse left on the slab below the bolt. Then move up. 2) Go up and left along the crack and hand traverse above the bolt. This way avoids the bolt. Both ways join after the traverse. Climb past a second bolt up to a small overlap.Follow the cracks up and left. Good friction on the slabs, but no real footholds, so it may get pumpy. Chained anchor on the ledge above.P3: 5.8. Several ways. If you belay at the anchor for the top of P2, take the first way: from the right edge of the ledge, follow the pair of cracks to a ramp feature that takes you to the corner. Near the start, you could clip a high bolt on the face, though it is probably not needed. (That bolt is for a face route \"City Bobcat\".) Then just follow the corner (5.7-5.8).If you move your belay over to the base of the corner (next ledge to the right), then you can either start at the base of the corner and do thin laybacking or stemming for the first 20' (at ~5.10) and then continue up the corner as with the first way. An intermediate way is to start here at the base of the corner, but undercling out left to bypass the difficult laybacking-stemming section (~5.9).Also, a direct face-crack finish to the right is possible (5.10). Veer off right of the main corner for the last 30' and go straight up. This is the variation \"...Sounding the Alarm\".Decent:Several rap anchors exist near the top. From the top of the pedestal, a 70 m might make it to the p2-3 anchor. With two 70s, you can rap directly to the base of p2, and take a few options down from there.",

Probably safe to say that you have never used this method to mount a ledge, and after this route will never use it again.On TR, one may instead hand traverse along the roof-ledge to a more common ledge mantle, but presently it is not equipped for a safe lead using this method.The route starts at the far right edge of the roof, ascending a short ramp to a slopey mantel. This part has no pro, but is relatively easy. Then clip a short cable draw (homemade) hanging just below the roof  and start traversing along the good edge. I tested a fall before clipping the second bolt and found the swing to be fine, though probably best not to jump back too much or you could swing into the tree (also be aware of the lower ledge). After mounting the roof-ledge, follow the crack trending left with excellent nut slots and then use the cracks just above for your last pieces. Finish by going back right to a the tree at the edge. The route zig-zags, but is short enough that drag is easily handled.*Name is a registered trademark of Greg Olsen. Used here with his permission.",

Some moves can be pretty physical, but they soon ease up for a brief rest before the next strenuous section.It is generally better to visit in summer and early fall as the left edge seeps in winter and spring, becoming a waterfall after heavy rain periods. During summer, early morning and evening are better times as the area can really bake in the midday sun.

The easiest and most sporting way is to use a horizontal crack for a short hand traverse leftward over to the Yes Larry corner where there are large footholds and a good rest.  Once over here, move up to the bolt and then work your way up into the chimney, which also has a bolt in it to clip. (To take the other way, follow the crack over the roof and then traverse left, your feet on the same horizontal as the recommended way. On this way, you could clip the Booty G- bolt with a long sling.)At the top of the short chimney, traverse right on the ledge, clip a bolt, and finish on the left-leaning hand crack of Booty Groover (which takes 2-3\" cams).Note that when you traverse over to Yes Larry, before stepping up to clip the bolt, you'll want to either place temporary pro (~1/2-3/4\" nuts or a 2-2.5\" cam) or leave the gear in and use a second rope before stepping up to clip the bolt.The gear on this route is good, but is currently listed as a TR because Jeff and I have only been here on solo missions so far.

        "route_description": "Burt's, or BAD for short, starts at the bottom left (west) of Lookout Point and ends at the top right. One could take this route as a way to eliminate some hiking to to reach parts of Planet Index or to reach other pitches on Lookout, but it is not a route to be rushed. It is fun, for one thing, but more importantly, one must be extremely careful not to knock loose rocks down.It can be pitched out many ways, and certainly possible to combine pitches, though probably good to plan on about nine pitches. Here's a breakdown of the way we pitched it out (also look at the images here and topo in the guide) and rough difficulty ratings:p1: Tight squeeze chimney for about 10', followed by some laybacking to a very large, spacious ledge. You should belay here, just because it is a nice ledge. The start should be pretty obvious, though also note the bolt here on the face for the belayer. (9+)p2: Follow flakes right to a large crack, then back left to another large ledge. Belay at the anchor near the cedar tree. (8)p3: Go up and right into the chimney-flake feature. Continue up to the base of Lou's slab and belay just above a tree. (7 or 8, depending on finish)p4: \"The little climb that could, wonders if it still can\". Walk, jam, and layback up a ramp-ledge that goes up and right to the ledge at the base of Velvet Pedestal (p2) and Say When. (4)p5: Go up the start of Say When to a point where you can traverse right to the belay at the top of the And Say finger crack. Do not stop here, but keep traversing, passing one bolt, then resume climbing up at a flake to another bolt and another traverse right ending at the Bus House ledge. (8)p6: Go up the wide crack, then either belay at the anchor (for top of crux finger crack of Solitude) and then walk up the handline to Solitude cave, or simply go directly to Solitude cave. Go through the cave to Buckminster's Palace. (8+)p7: (We actually broke this up into two, though for hot days you may want to combine these two to avoid a sun-baked belay at the last Solitude belay) Go up a rib feature past one bolt, following a broken corner, then step left for a short face section past a bolt. Just above is the last Solitude belay. You might skip that and continue up the corner to a roof. Finger traverse right, then clip a high bolt, and continue traversing until reaching a crack going up and right. Face climb on big holds and step right to trees. This puts you on Red Tile Camp. (9+)p8: Walk along the treed ledge to the anchor with a runner. Climb up the face to the bolt. This start is the same as LOPD (p3). Upon reaching the small roofs, instead of going left, go over the roofs. Then traverse right to an anchor at the base of a short slab. (9+)p9: Go up the broken corner and flakes, then follow the short slabby ramp up and right. There is a short handline here to a tree at the top. (4)",

Since then, a new trail to the wall was made, and the wall has has been brought to life with many new routes. Halloween features over 20 single pitch climbs with a little bit of something for everyone, but is notable for its short approach, unique angled cracks, and density of high quality 5.9 - 5.10 routes.While at Halloween, please be respectful with noise. This is one of the closest crags to the town of Index, so please don't scream, play loud music, etc. Just be a good sport and if you see someone causing a problem, please ask them respectfully to stop.",
    "area_getting_there": "The approach takes about 15 minutes. The easiest way to get there is to follow the trail shown in the Climbing Map on this page.Park in town at Doolittle or across the road at Heybrook Ridge and follow the Lookout Point trail to the Midnite boulder. Before passing the Midnite boulder, turn right down the Trilium trail. Continue for a few minutes until you see a small trail heading right down a winding path to the base of the wall. At the time of this writing there's an orange sign that says 'Happy Halloween' on a tree with 3 trunks pointing to the right towards the trail, but it's a little hard to see. Follow this winding trail for a few minutes to meet the base of the wall. As you walk across the trail, you will pass along the top of the Leaky Cauldron. To get to the Leaky Cauldron head right/straight at the junction on the boulders once passing through the stairs. For all other routes, continue left along the wall.",

There was an old trail we took down to town that delivered us into the Grafton's backyard. From what I read, Sam died in 2018, so apparently he and Fred had abandoned the crag long before. Probably didn't name it after themselves though. It would be neat to hear more about the early scrubbing missions. The only bolt I noticed was over on what is now Pumpkin Spice, though Ben found others.  Anyway, as this is closer to town than Hag and Zappa, both of which were clearly climbed on by 1980, so I suppose this one too probably had pre-2000 explorers and ascents. Aug 4, 2022",

Double rack is fine · Lead / Fell/Hung. w/ sam! first climb of climbersfest! fucked myself with rope drag, spent a minute trying to pull up enough slack to clip the chains, rested with an armload of rope in my mouth, ended up having to grab the chains to clip. otherwise was clean! first 5.10 on gear! · Lead / Redpoint. Got the red point! Carol and I are buds now. As I said before, such a good route! · Lead / Onsight. 2x Black totems and 2x #.75. Be careful with rope drag; extend the bottom pieces. · Lead / Flash. Such a good line! I think it’s a classic in the making - pumpy, ended up hanging because I’m weak. But so good · Follow. Followed Stephen’s lead. Dirty, sharp, balance, and gear was tricky. Glad that I was following. · Lead / Onsight. Excellent route, start is not that bad. Take care of rope drag, it gets really bad · Blue & green alien, red alien Orange metolious .3,.4 double.5-2 Maybe extra yellow/grey aliens!? · Lead / Redpoint. Whole thing clean expect pulled chains on the last move… did not extend for rope drag well. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Water coming out of final crack system on traverse to chains. Was difficult not to get your hands drenched in water. Bolder start was more committing that it originally appeared from the ground. Next time consider placing gear from lock off right before you mantle in middle section of climb. #1 C4 was great. Be mindful of the rope drag! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Great climb, felt appropriately spooky for the crag leading this for the first time due to the committing moves. Will come back for the send. Black or blue totem, or #2 slightly higher to protect the low crux - stem into the big round sloper (more positive on the left side as a sidepull). Then R foot on good chip, jam both hands in some order in the crack, L foot rock over onto sloping ledge, L hand up on sidepull edge of strata, stand up. Crux sequence leaving the first sloping ledge: .4 around corner, balance on good foot on face to the right, .3 in finger crack. Work up finger crack with L hand to hidden jug around the next ledge (R hand). Place #1 in horizontal. Instead of mantling, continue left to another good incut hold, work L hand to it, then foot up onto ledge and big move R hand to crimpy sidepull. Stand up and get L hand to good sidepull just above. From there, place shallow .75 in pod on the right. Work up and right on jug rail and place a .4 or .5. Keep working right and mantel. Throw in #2 at the rest. Work R hand into furthest left good jam in crack. R foot up onto small slopey hold, L foot way up and left onto another small foot. Work hands on slopey but decent ledges up and left to anchor. No good clipping jugs so be careful. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Max lead. Had some takes. Haley flashed on TR. would love to lead- only heady part would be mantling above finger crack section. So fun though. Max trd after and also flashed. Beta for boulder problem start, right hand on good left facing hold, left foot out to little spot on face, then reach left hand up and over to great flake · Lead / Onsight. Climbed as warmup with Tim and Jess. Fun route, thuggish start. Would do again for sure · Lead / Flash. Dunno why commenters are hating on the first moves, they're great bouldery fun and the rest of the route is great wandery crack climbing. Good route. · Lead / Onsight. Fun steep climbing great holds and prop where you need it. Boulder move of the ground is the crux but protects well with a .5 then 2 above a perfect hand jam (back clean .5 after placing 2) · Lead. Lead with Fin. Had to come off the boulder to sus things out but hopped right back on and flashed the rest of the climb. First real trad lead, soooo fun."

Follow the crack left on bomber gear and mostly easy moves to the finish2. For a bit more exciting of a finish, go up just after the crux and stand on a mini-ledge then reach up and to the back for layback jugs you can ride to the top (a #6 may be useful, but the moves are 5.7-5.8ish). See the orange line on the topo in the photo gallery.Note: 'Lisle' could reasonably be considered a new climb or an old one.

I decided to down/side lead back to the top of the roof and french-free to the Sam (.12a) anchors. The only issue there is that you must trust a huge detached block to gain the ledge where the anchor is. It seems solid, but it looks scary, and there really is no way around it"

Best to place some small gear right before the crux then run it out; fun varied route but kinda a one move wonder · TR. Superb climb with the most solid rock on the wall.

One of my favorite ever outdoor climbs make sure your rope is long enough as mine was about 60m and we just barely had enough rope to make it work by about a foot or two. Crux at second clip and at upper section with a kinda big move/reach to a nice rail and then mantle. Lots of mantles on this route for sure! 11/10 climb. Not sure about the terror part though this climbs pretty chill. · Lead. Couldn't find a static way to hang the draw couple bolts from the top, ended up traversing left up and back right over the top. · Lead / Onsight. Haley lead and flashed. I think this should be called “praying mantle” with the 4-5 mantle’s required for this climb:). I did fudge the upper crux a bit and went left. I was too short to reach the required hold up and to the right. Max made it to that hold, but then was to tired to do the required mantle up onto the ledge. Next time · TR. Climbed clean on top rope with Tim Matsui and Jess. Tim led. Lower Cruz at dish to mantle felt great. Upper crux on reachy mini roof is physical and would be spicy on lead · Lead / Fell/Hung. Greased off the lower crux (mantle after bolt 2) expecting better holds. The top is not a dyno and not the crux. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took many times at upper crust dyno but couldn’t hit it and lowered. Maybe hand ledge for feet next time and won’t need dyno? · Lead / Fell/Hung. Onsight except grabbed draw to clip after pulling second crux. Couldn’t see feet and ended up dangling from one arm to clip bolt. W/ Emma · Lead / Fell/Hung. Excellent pitch. Was at the 2nd to last bolt, stepped up. Two bolts close together and standing up on the slab move the draw of the bolt below (very closely spaced) somehow snagged my figure 8 (way to have an onsight get shut down AFTER the crux) · Lead / Onsight. Reach crux move for sure. With Andrew and Woody and Jess and Maple and a lil bit of sun. · Lead / Fell/Hung. This was hard and took all I had. One section way above the clip (second crux) was horribly insecure and I barely made the next clip. The crimpy dyno section was very height oriented but felt impossible to me. · TR. First crux amazing balancing move, loved it! Second crux seems very hard, unless you find two superb foot placements in the horizontal crack which you can't really see from above. · TR. Two cruxes, harder one up top. Use horizontal crack for feet, muscle up. · Lead / Fell/Hung. fell once near top. it's all there, look around you bozo"

Follow this trail to a crest, then go right (left goes to boulders). A casual, garden-like section takes to to a large boulder (Midnite).From this boulder are two ways to go. The old way is to go straight, passing west of the boulder then uphill through some forest and talus for another 5 minutes to a T junction. Head right. Continue for 5-10 minutes, trending right to the base of Private Idaho. The trail traverses along the base of Private Idaho. (If you miss the turnoff to Private Idaho then when the talus hits the wall, go right and traversing along the base of Lookout Point (just above Private Idaho), then you will eventually reach a gully. Hag Crag is at the bottom of this gully, just to the east.)  If you take the earlier right turn at the talus, then traverse to the end of this wall where there is the popular  Senior Citizens in Space corner crack. Keep going up and right to the next wall and you are there.Since 2019 there has been a quicker trail that goes directly to Hag. At Midnite, take the right turn just in front of the boulder and head east along the meandering trail. Pass some boulders, cross a small talus field, and then go up past two short bluffs (the upper one has a waterfall in winter and spring). The trail gets steeper here and goes directly up to Hag Crag from below.",

Post a note here if one needs replacement, thanks.For wide-area brushing, the long handled wire brush here is better than the ones often left at the base (also, the handle bends up so you are less likely to scrape a knuckle). Don't put much pressure on the brush and do too much scrubbing in one spot if you need excellent friction there (e.g., left side friction routes & Free Cat) as the metal bristles can smoothen the rock. If there is thick moss in the way, you might instead use the back side of the \"kama\" (serrated scythe) tool to scrape it off.The kama will get nearly anything out of a crack, thin crack or thick. Be careful with it while it is still sharp. (Gets dull quick, yet still will be adequate for any crack here.)The broom is useful for the top-out ledge area and places that have loose dirt.",

Or, one can do the extended finish, going to the top (5.8), though this might presently be difficult to protect except at the start.Shares the same start as On the Rebound.There is a walk-up anchor at the top, about 25' above the old anchor for this route.

This is a neat route but it might be soul crushing for a 7 leader. kind of a weird slab chimney hybrid. The roof has a huge #5 crack but you can't really use it, a lot of it was slab feet with opposing butt pressure. Take extra big gear, 2s, 3s, maybe 4s · Lead / Flash. Haley and Max lead. I was happy that I got the guts to lead this climb. The pro is really good. And I stood with my back against the chimney and that felt so secure. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Grabbed some gear while fishing the rope out from under my body, but made it up. This one was a battle. Yeehaw. · Follow. Stiff grading, felt like being birthed lol. Climbed facing out for half of the flare, then turned around. Cleaned anchors. Put your back into it! Woody on belay. · TR. Clean TR. Really fun. Did the tall chimney thing with my back to the rock. Would have been challenging to place gear in that position · Follow. Felt a bit easier than last time, still don't want to lead it · Lead. Traversing the mossy slab to the lower anchors for the bolt line didn’t make sense. There is an anchor at the top of the crack. I could have used 2-3 #2’s. I did use 2x #4 and one #5 · Lead / Onsight. Mitch’s 3rd climb outdoors! This is a super fun one with some hand jams, slab, layback and a comfy partial chimney that you can just scoot up · Lead / Redpoint. The line is on low angle slab, interesting with different types of cracks. First part has good hand jam. Overall the cracks are pretty uniform, so I had to be lowered down to retrieve #1,#2, #3 BD, or back clean. I was flowing with layback, but to lead and place gear, I had to use hand jams, left foot jam, and right foot smearing on slab to be able to see the crack. It's a bit awkward and uncomfortable, maybe low angle corner (deep) crack isn't my thing, maybe try layback and placing gear on the crack above next time. The chimney section is super fun. I had my feet smearing on slab, back pressing on the chimney/roof, left hand bar in the big crack and right hand placing gear. I placed a couple gear in the bottom crack, having to reach really far. I never climbed a route like this, but was confident with pro, so ended up sewing it up while exploring different beta. Placed a #4. · Lead / Onsight. Definitely bring three 2's. Didn't realize I was gonna inch worm the entire way up. So glad I was wearing pants. My shoulders on the otherhand took a beating. Don't necessarily think I need to do this again. · Lead. Opted to climb crack with Right side of body on slab. Decidedly unenjoyable chimney-esq climbing. Not horrible because very protectable (so long as you have an abundance of 2s). Placed: one # 0.5, 0.75, 1, 3, 4 and five #2s. · TR. Set this up on TR by going above. Had a bit of a fiasco as i set up on anchors too far to the left so missed the chains. So went back up again and moved over to the 2 bolts to repel 15 feet to the anchors for this climb. Anyway- climb on TR was super cool. Great for practicing different styles of crack and chimney techniques. · TR. Honestly loved this climb. Did it facing the crack as opposed to feet out. Used by right arm to chicken wing, right foot to jam the crack and then used left to scoot myself upwards. Very OW like. A ton of fun. Weird getting to the anchors, I had to turn outward felt kinda fumbly . Need to lead this one · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fine climbing, then went straight in at the flaring corner #2 size. Once it got wider, I placed a #4 then went for the big jug which ended up being a large loose chockstone. I started slipping and had Aubrey take as I down climbed to the #4. After collecting myself, I rerouted to utilize the slab to the right more, with my back against the other side. Easy climbing, but just a bit runout. Finished up fine. · TR. Super fun on top rope!!! Might be a bit heady on lead. Key was to press back against upper wall. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took a silly fall low down, and then did the chimney clean. Felt much better than a year ago, now that I actually know how to crack climb. I'm A 5.9 cLiMbEr lololol · Lead. Bailed on route due to pouring rain, made it half way up on lead. · Lead. Faced out in the middle section & loved it. Used 4 & 5 in the roof since I don't possess infinite #2s. · Fucking loved this thing. Maybe not enough to do it again! What a fight! I lead it belly down. Shane followed it belly up with a few turns and he seemed to have an easier time. Maaaaaaybe I'll try it again that way. · Lead / Onsight. One of the funnest routes I’ve done, silly climbing in the chimney · TR. S L A B B Y and felt partly like an intro to off-widths at points, but so fun! I loved it! · TR. Climbed up partway as part of trad lead climb workshop with KAF adventures · TR. Grovelly. Crux at bulge and after where you flip back to face the slab. Take plenty of 2’s · Lead. bit funky. leading and placing pro/being secure requires being deep in the corner. slabbing seems like it'd be great on TR with a clean slab · TR. 1 fall. Lie backing into a crazy overhanging corner requiring a hold behind you · Lead / Onsight. Could use more larger gear. Ran it out a bit towards the top. Cool chimney movement though! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Wack. Bailed off at the lower anchors, got stuck jamming in the corner and didn't like it. Sounds like I just needed to stand up, but the overhead crack wasn't that awe-inspiring. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took a while up top, working on efficiently placing & evaluating good gear but felt secure in each move · Lead. I ran this out a shit ton and the 60 foot fall potential was a trip · Lead / Pinkpoint. bailey hung most of the gear, I finished a few pieces · TR. Very fun climb, Lots of stemming and interesting crack. Could set up a top rope from the top but would be nice to be able to redirect the rope with cams · Lead / Onsight. First WA trad lead of 2023! This was a lot for me lol. Climbed the majority of it on my back somehow but was good for the head and alpine season · TR. Fun climb but placing gear would be a little tricky for the second half · TR. Super fun, super burley. If I lead out gear on right hip. Eventually turns to face climbing at the top. Much more fun than the 5.6 or 5.9 we did. · Lead / Onsight. Weirdest 5.7 I've climbed yet. All I could say at the anchor was \"What the fuck?\" Fun route. · Lead / Onsight. Doubles from .3 to 3 and a 4 felt adequate if you go deeper into the crack. Honestly could have gotten away with just 3s & lower. Eats 2s up · TR. Super fun, set up a top rop from the Hag Crack with a redirect. · Lead / Onsight. takes large gear only (several #2/#3) except for the very start. I had to run it out which made it less fun. It’s basically a chimney 2/3 of the route. · Lead / Onsight. ran out of gear at chimney, came down. Seth climbed, ran out the chimney and lead on 2 more pieces to the anchor. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Several takes. Very awkward climbing and difficult to place gear in the crack which is deep within the cavern. Probably won’t repeat. · Lead / Flash. w/ Defne incredibly unique--in the middle I was just finding it 'annoying' but it's a good challenge. Takes all the gear all the way, ultra safe. · Lead / Onsight. Climbed it horribly wrong but sent it! Ended up with feet in the top crack and climbed inverted for a bit. Fun and burly."

Nervous at first since the gear looks small but it's all very solid · TR. couldn't commit for the crux move but I think the sequence should work: left foot jam, pull on left side crimp, right foot up to tiny ledge, pull up and reach the jug high up right, left foot on the big knob. got to come back for this. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Stout for the grade, safe lead and fun! Probably much easier for tall folk, and far harder for shorties. · Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Martin - had a ton of fun on this pitch!

Then jam left foot in, get right hand on the extremely small crimp, move left hand over to the sideways crimp, then readjust left foot to a bit higher and not a jam.

Hung after first bolt to take some test falls, but would have been able to send without no problem. · Lead / Redpoint. Punted twice at the bottom. Once before the first bolt, once after. Sent third try with first bolt clipped. · TR. I cleaned inside most of the finger cracks, I tried to climb it but I fell at the first bolt because the crack before it was drenched.

This rig would have a line on it if it was located @ LTW--but that goes without saying for all the classics out there that actual require a modicum of hiking and resolve to get off the beaten track. Bring jeans or a knee pad. Thanks Michal and Stig. Jul 15, 2019",

I ripped hanger 5 or 6 off the wall when I fell on the undercling move. Seemed fine when I clipped. I left it clipped to the belay anchors below. Great route all in all. Amazing movement way up there. Feels airy. · I did not get the last move, but to me the logical way I see to go is up and left which would make it easier maybe 12b. Currently there’s a lot of dirt there and needs some cleaning, but could ge good. The current 12d way seems counterintuitive since there’s a ledge you can stand on 1ft to your left. But again I didn’t send it so I don’t know for sure. · Follow. Ha! Spent day 1 rapping down the adjacent cliffs looking for the route, and Day 2 getting shut down · Lead / Redpoint. FA with Michal. First go for both of us on my last day in Index for five weeks. Super happy."

Steve lead P1 (mossy and dirty but mostly fine, getting around chockstone on left side was spicy), I flailed & aided some of p2. 2x#4 and 2x#5 for p2. Top out spooky, lots of detached blocks held together by moss and hope, didn't place any gear after the last #5. 10a? Felt at least as hard as 11's in the creek. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Made it all the way through the offwidth to the end but was too gassed to pull final jug. Should have used footholds above roof in this section. Oops. · 2 pitches. Follow. Climbing it as two pitches is recommend unless the leader is confident with off width. The intermediate belay station protects the off width section much better. I led the first half and let my partner lead the second half. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took once after roof. Felt too pumped to bump 5 or run it out to anchors but was only one more move to jugs. TR clean. W/ Emma and Ben S. · 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Led p1, top roped p2 twice. Elbow jams were the key · TR. Fell once, took once. Used lessons learned from lead. Use the small feet out left and right, much easier that way! Hand stacks undercling prior to roof allowed me to position feet precisely from stable position. · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell a couple times on lead on second pitch. Got pretty pumped out doing bicep/elbow locks before integrating my second arm to facilitate arms locks. Learned not to bump feet too high up relative to hand/butterfly stacks. Moving back up into layback upper hands from that position is not very doable on vertical to slightly overhung terrain, feels very desperate compared to nearly straight lower/in corner leg nearly extended. Layback through the roof. Transitioning back into the crack is challenging but works with knee locks. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead the first pitch clean. Interesting pulling around the chockstone. Plugged a #3 deep back behind the chockstone with a double length extension and then climbed up around left of the chockstone. Started leading the second pitch. Difficult fist crack, slightly overhung and a little too large for me to get bomber fist jams. Feet felt okay if you get them deep enough. Fell lots of times, leapfrogging the 4s until the roof and then same with the 5s above. Glorious jugs just above the roof. Learned 5s are knee locks for me. 4s are difficult. Ended up arm batting with left arm + pulling into right face with right hand while bumping feet up. I think liebacking the crack would have been more straightforward but too pumpy for me to lead on such slippery feet on the left wall of the right facing dihedral. · Lead / Onsight. Cool climb. Prob tried too hard to OW the moves. Next time need to see if I can get a calf lock (At) · Lead / Fell/Hung. Literally aided my way past the 4”-5” section. Then TR’d it. Gear: single small to 3”, doubles 4” and 5”. Smart to have triple 4”. Feels like 5.10c · TR. Learned a lot. Still took twice but getting closer to being capable of a proper lead. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took once at the roof. .75, .3, .5, 8x alpines, 3x 4, 5. Should go next time · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Followed pitch 1 fell on pitch 2 probably won’t come back but if I do remember to lie back at the top. It seemed very close. · Lead / Fell/Hung. fell, then cheated at crux. did it without falling on toprope afterwards so need to go back and try again. · 2 pitches. Followed the first pitch (no falls). Flailed and fell leading the upper pitch. What an amazing route · Lead / Fell/Hung. at least I didn't have to pull on gear this time... and had energy left to TR the roof clean... · TR. Burly. Used plenty of laybacking. Perhaps try 'elevator door' technique to make prettier attempt another time."

Think I could lead this. Thought the moves past the second roof felt awkward and hard! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Misread the second roof -> from the golden bucket don't get sucked left onto the face, layback the crack above the bucket until it gets to be solid hands, then step over. Lower roof was fun laybacking with back step stemming · I liked every part of this with the exception of the “overhanging double crack traverse of sadness” · Lead / Redpoint. Warm up. Committing to the first crux felt hard. Rest was good. What an amazing route. One of the single best 10- pitches I’ve climbed. · TR. Felt much easier. Really good movement. Cruxes are still physical but VERY manageable. · Follow. Clean follow. Gear double to #3 fine? Stem right foot before committing to layback, could put a 0.5 ish cam in slot, L foot transition to foot jam, don't try to stop mid layback for gear otherwise.. Very wild and exposed feeling pitch. · Lead. Super fun! 1 take at second bolt bc pumpy -undercling the first roof w a stem on the right corner, then there is a great jug but fairly high up · TR. easy to get sucked up and right of the bolt. use weird crack system and jugs to get up to bucket, then off to the left and up: · Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Clemo - fun route! I thought crux came just after first bolt · Lead / Onsight. dude the bucket is sooo good, also that bolt is very nice to have there. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Slipped at first crux. Smooth on the second attempt. Similar to Tatoosh, varied and pitchy. If Tatoosh is 10b this is 9+ · Lead / Fell/Hung. Felt at the bolt moving out left but felt smooth after finding the holds · Lead / Redpoint. Rp after greasing off a foot at bottom crux a few days ago ha · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fiddled up top with the second roof pull. Great climb! More fun than rogers corner · Follow. Followed clean. Big jugs the whole way with two solid power moves. Achievable one day · Lead / Onsight. I stemmed the crux instead of laybacking into a jam in the left crack. My beta felt much harder than 10a. Look at the roof before climbing again. · TR. Neat route! Crux for me was the lieback above the bolt, and the stem from the bucket to the arete · Lead / Onsight. Had a rope get fucked up stuck in the small crack above the bucket on TR · TR. Pretty cruiser. A little pumpy due to where Tommy placed gear, had to remove midway through strenuous position on second roof. · Lead / Flash. Pretty heady. Stem/chimney through the bottom roof and it’s not too terrible. High feet pulling the second roof to rock over and stand up. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell twice in lower crux, took on second crux. Got rope stuck and learned how to ascend a rope. · Lead / Flash. Got beta watching Kevin. Move pulling the first roof was the crux for me. · Lead / Onsight. Max lead , Haley Trd. Cool climb!

Fell at the corner crux. Dialed the moves on TR, gotta come back. · Lead / Onsight. Super fun and felt super comfy all the way through it · Lead. 2 #4 2 #2 and some smaller (I think I used a .3 and .75) · TR. One fall at 5th bolt trying to deadpoint into jam off slopers. Next go easier to lock off with left hand jam, move left foot higher stemming then smear right foot higher then right hand jam. · Lead / Onsight. Cool climb. Very different than the neighbor to the left. Feels like a tall person climb · Lead / Fell/Hung. led it clean as a flash go, but grabbed the bush to the left because i was kinda scared to clip the high bolt. · Lead / Fell/Hung. One hang at crux and then once after placing the 4. So pumped. Gear, in order - QD, QD, .4 or .5, .3, QD, 3, 4, 5, 2, .2. Mussy hooks up top. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Max lead. Had a couple takes/falls. Then he proceeded to get his foot literally jammed in the crack on the upper 3rd of the climb-it took at least 30 minutes for him to finally get it out. He was able to get his foot out of his shoe, then had to clip a draw to the shoe and pull hard. Always some fiasco :). So fun to TR. i struggled moving from the top of the 10 crack to the big crack section. There was nothing for my feet since I’m short. But finally found a little indent for my left toe on the foot rail, then smeared and lunged for the bomber hold. · Lead / Onsight. Didn’t find the first bolt spicy to clip. Great gear, secure movement · Lead / Fell/Hung. .4, .5, 3, 4, .3, five QDs (2 for anchor), two singles, one double. Didn’t need stick clip with stem/drop knee to first bolt. · Lead / Onsight. Difficult cruxes with hard to read beta, but fun offwidth stem section · Lead / Onsight. Really good route. Challenging and fairly blue collar. Gear: draws, single rack tips to 5”, slings. No nuts needed. · Follow. wizard aaron, erika, alissa & john, tom & emily; couldn't figure out last bolt, eventually had to dyno in. · Lead / Onsight. I think I did 90% of the moves wrong. Still got it though. Oh well... (At) · Lead / Onsight. no harder than golden bucket. having a 4 would be nice if this is pushing your grade · Lead / Onsight. Really fun! And climbs better than it looks. But it requires a #4 which I didn’t bring! · TR. Come back and lead, crux was before second bolt and wide crack was super fun · TR. 22 weeks pregnant; made it two bolts before the skinny chimney that was not belly friendly · TR. clean but awkward in the move to the corner and move to the third bolt, something to work on · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell once after 2nd draw, foot slip, with weird positioning getting into the weird flared crack system. Careful with the start, especially getting past 1st bolt.

Make sure to jam feet in pods at top · 4 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Wear new miuras. Possibly place two blues off deck and black totem up higher from a left hand in the top good part of finger crack and keeping the feet low on the right smudge · TR. Fun follow after Micah led. This rig is exquisite and I am excited to try and lead it · TR. Onsight the route and aid the reach crux move, after reading beta, the move seems interesting - throw to high left hand with good right hand and foot and ok left hand - kinda committing move. Would try it next time. Pretty exciting finger lock/hang jam the rest of route. · TR. Clean 2nd go on TR, would take quite an effort on lead. So much fun. Bouldery cruxes separated by decent rests. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell twice at the lower crux, then sent the upper section clean. Improvement! · Lead. One hang. Get through low crux with 3 small blues, step up feet then into left hand jam - place small purple from jam, don’t place anything in hand jam, you need to match in right hand then get highs feet and up to left finger jam. At upper crux, get right foot into jam, left hand on knob, then right all the way up to good jam. · Lead / Redpoint. Finally sent! It all felt so easy. Just went for it and cruised. My first 11b! · TR. I think I could lead it. Would want lots of small gear, protecting frequent at the bottom of the 11b finger crack to protect from decking on the ledge. Good feet at bottom and top crux sequence. · Lead / Redpoint. Woot! Felt desperate at the top but managed to squeak it out. Met Shannon and Sam. · Lead. Almost took the spike to the head when laybacking the sinker fingers section went awry. Employed technique next go and it was a cruise. Such a great rock climb. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Tried to put it together but fell once at top Crux. Fuck! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung twice trying to figure out gear beta at bottom and top hard parts · Lead / Fell/Hung. Two falls at the top (one at crux and one at mantel). Sad bc I thought I would send but so fun!!! Felt great tbh · TR. TRS, didn't get bottom clean but got top clean which was rad . Reachy beta: stand on pedastool at base of first finger crack, the key is to get your right hand into the top of the finger crack where it angles open, thumbs down. Don't reach too high to get this, paw your way up the lower finger crack. There's knobs for feet on the left mini arete and then one good stem foot on your right that like actually maybe isn't that good. Slap that right thumbs down finger jam in and bump the right foot to a high and strenuous but good edge on the right crack and hecking throw that left hand for the hand jam. It doesn't get cruisy between here and the next crux but it's easier. Upper crux, find the sloppy texture on the left wall and remember it. Work your feet up the right cracks knobs and mini platforms kind of lay backing until you can get your left fingers in a marginal pocket. Toe jam your right foot in the pod on the right crack and stand up. In the bigger upper pocket of the crack on the right side there is a deep jug but it's way back there. Smear that left on the texture, bump your right foot up to another jam and launch for the chalky jug above you. From here there is a manky but stellar finger lock to slap before grabbing the finishing jug. · Lead. I am soooo strong. I am soooo cool. Jake is soooo lucky to be married to me. I am a champion of rocks. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Beta: Left hand little pocket right hand finger lock at crux. 0.5 cam above 0.4 below. · Lead / Redpoint. Steve was right. First lead attempt after 1x TR, no mock lead. Lower left crack: #2x2, #3x2, #4x1, clipped tat with locker alpine. Upper crack climb 2 moves, blu tot, blk tot, stepped back down to rest. 0.2 (blk tot better), blk tot (0.4/0.5 off next to), 0.5 z4, 0.3 z4, blu tot, purp tot (flared, careful!), then gun it. Got a full knee jam in pod before upper crux, decent rest but leaning back so not amazing. DO NOT place any 0.75-1 in the hand/foot pods or you're fucked. · TR. TRonsight, no gear placements. Steve scampered over from toxic shock anchors (with some gear & back cleaning shenanigans). Steve says I should lead it. · TR. Fell repeatedly figuring out the beta. Good candidate for a project to redpoint it. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Ooooooeeeee! Proud I led this without watching anyone, but it was tough. · 2 pitches. TR. Two Tr laps. First crux, 2 .3 totems. High rh finger lock, high left foot. Big move to lh crimp, bump up rf, rh sloper, wedge lf in corner, reach rh to hand jam. .5 and .2 totem then rest. Second crux, red Metolius and .4 totem high. Use smearing lf. Then .75 totem to protect exit moves · Lead / Fell/Hung. Crux is off the ledge. Climb .3s crack with thumbs down jams. Use feet out to the sides. Good dihedral on the left and bad smears on the right. Decent flare jam on the left when 2 cracks start. Can stem between two small dihedrals then to rest and place gear. Top section is easier with high feet into wider jams. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 hang at top crux, messed up the hand sequence and couldn’t recover. See notes 7/17 for details, pic 7/17 for gear beta. · 3 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. One hang, got gassed at top in upper crux, potentially there’s a rest I didn’t get. Knee bar? Bottom crux —-two left feet on arete, right foot close dimple to further smudge to inner indentation by crack to higher seam. Right hand to the bread loaf can use the triangle crimp if needed. Two blues as high as you can with a black totem once you’re on your feet. Upper crux use second hold in seam to two upper parallel spots with left foot on a good face smear. Yellow cam to protect the move in the left slot. · TR. Got it clean the second time. Finger jams up top were neat. Required solid feet to keep weight off the hands. · TR. Fell not too many times, fun route might come back to lead when stronger · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell off the ledge - didn’t focus on feet enough. fell again at top crux big move, slightly missed the right hand finger lock. · TR. w/ vincent and chris. First route in Index! Took a few laps, couldn't get it while placing gear, only on TR. Great finger crack practice · Lead / Fell/Hung. Clean on TR after. Gear: doubles from 0.2 to 0.75. One #1. 3/4 for the start. Look for smaller foot out right off the ledge. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 hang at the finish. Bring 3 .3 . Super fun! · TR. Amazing finger Two cruxes 1: layback and reach for the hand jam 2: Right hand side pull, left foot flag after smear on the left. Left finger jam and bump to the crimp, until right hand reach for the good side pull. · TR. Second TR. aided cruxes with stirrups. Off the ground it’s hard, turns to easier laybacking, turns to finger cracking, turns to two boulder problems. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 2 falls, a bit wet still including the fingers before the final big move · TR. So good. Need to lead. Tried twice, 1st try hard, 2nd try 1 hung With tj · TR. Awesome route. Great rests, use fingerlocks with stemmed feet for right off the horn. Last sequence through crux - stay tight but get those feet up! Great gear · TR. Fell twice cause decided to get desperate instead of being chill and just sending · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell a few times. Felt good I’ll get on it again for sure. · Lead / Fell/Hung. fell at pump crux. high balancey left foot jam gets off the ledge · Lead / Fell/Hung. Top crux: squeeze index finger at the bottom of 0.75-1 crack, reach up right pinky down, bump left hand up to two finger pocket, pull feet up and put right foot in pod to jam. · Lead / Flash. One fall on first go, sent it on second go! Bring triples from .2 - .5, double .75, single 1 and 2, and two 3s for the atart · Lead / Fell/Hung.

This would be a better first trad lead than corner flash across the hallway. · Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Brain. Stayed in the RIGHT crack the entire lead.

There is a juggy vertical edge that can be combined with a hand jam to be super secure. TR sessioned the left crack once and the right crack one more time to clean. Used #4 up high on lead. · Lead. Didn't like it - probably should have brought 2x #3 and maybe an extra #4 to get great gear in away from the flakes? Wouldn't climb again though · Lead. With Lindsey :) sow wide???

You definitely will be happier if you have a variety of small sized cams.  You'll definitely be happier if you have 5-6 runners.  On several of the bolts that protected mantle moves, I clipped both a QD and a runner.  After pulling the move I back cleaned the QD.  Although this sounds unconventional, it protected any ledge falls while pulling the harder moves and then left gear to protect while I moved up easier terrain that didn't create much rope drag.  Alternatively one could used doubled runners, then extend after pulling the move. As for the grade, it's definitely easier if you protect in a manner that reduces drag.  Since I was aware of the potential drag issues and protected the line accordingly, it really did feel like a 5.9.  I watched someone climb it later that only used QD's to protect it and it for sure looked like it made for a grade or two increase in effort and difficulty.  So HOW one protects this one really affects its subjective grade significantly.  If one were to climb this on TR, the grade would feel spot on.

Even so, layback is still easier than jaming where left toe is in the crack instead of right toe, body is sucked into the crack this way and finger becomes immediately less insecure. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on my second and then third piece, a .4 and .5, respectively. One fall on each. Both bomber. Placed (I believe) a .5, .4, and another .5 in the corner finger crack at the start before running out to the jug atop the finger crack. Made it up to the slung horn, slung a doubled 240cm sling to protect the unprotected slab move. Before making the slab move, it started to rain. Pushed through the mental barrier and made the unprotected move. Places a high .75 right after in bottom of the horizontal crack back and to the left of the slab at head level. Made it up to the corner “rest” right before the splitter hands. Took after each piece on the splitter from being pumped and likely going to pull off. The splitter was hands to thin hands and wider hands (#3). A .3 or .4 piece was placed higher up in the splitter to take on and then a #3. Racked evening on left side, remember to rerack before the slab move. Triples from .3 to #1. Doubles #2 and #3. Maybe triples next time on the splitter. · TR. Climbed with Eric Etzell. Attempted to lead but got stuffed on the layback · Lead / Onsight. Struggled way more on the first bit than I should've but was still fun · Lead. One small fall at the top of the layback mainly due to getting in my head and losing body tension. Got back on it and sent after without issues. Top’s tough since the crack leans a bit. Such a good climb. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Gassed out and fell at the top of the bd red crack. Took way too much time placing way too much gear. · Lead / Redpoint. Lower section went super smooth, faffed a bit getting into the upper crack · Lead / Fell/Hung. Chris led it then left a .4 and .5 for me to top rope through the layback start. Possible to place the .4 myself perhaps? The upper .5 was in the way tbh, caused the rope to run right where my fingers needed to be. Led the rest. Clipping the tat before the big step was a marginal idea, caused some rope drag. The upper leaning hand crack took a 3 at the bottom, 2 1s, and a .75 or .5. A 3rd 3 would have really sewed it up before the chains, but there’s a great #2-sized jam as the last move. · Lead / Redpoint. Warm-up. Still 1 L foot slip in layback but nbd. Doubles 0.3 to 3, 1 nut, didn't use blk tot or smaller. Purple offset nut & yel tot before slab corner. Upper crack more annoying with only 2x #1's · Lead / Redpoint. The layback start felt so much easier than I remembered it. Nice finger locks. Very satisfying to come back to a route and be able to tell I’m a much better climber than I was 3 years ago. · Lead / Redpoint. I think I onsighted this a long time ago but I did it again today. Great route · Lead / Fell/Hung. laybacked the lower part of the route. move to get established in the upper crack was heady but fine. used 3 #1s in upper hand crack · Lead / Redpoint. True start, no warmup. Basically double rack to #3 (yes used 2x #3), couple nuts and blk tot. Step up into corner still spooky. · TR. Mock lead. Should be able to lead next time. There is a slabby move transitioning from layback crack to the money crack. It's quite sketchy for short ppl, can place a marginal pro with smallest nut. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at the bottom but send the rest - next time will know to just commit to the layback all the way to the right jug · Lead / Fell/Hung. oof, one hang on layback, had trouble on handcrack, need to do more of a layback/jam combo on parts with my thic hands. Finished it up on toprope · TR. Fun, bottom is a lil strenuous. A bit spooked about the slabby traverse - would want really good gear right below the ledge but it's kind of blocky? Upper crack is bomber gear and safe falls though · Lead / Redpoint. Finally got the tr send. Ridiculous that I only felt brave enough to do this after a few beers and sending Even Stevens earlier in the week. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Wiped once on my first piece, I slipped on new shoes, you can protect this low crux by squeezing two finger size cams as high as you can, then grip it and rip it, not too bad if you commit to the moves. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 2 falls at the beginning, tried to finger jam but lie-backing was the move tight hands for me up above! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on lieback move, need to be more efficient on placing pro and liebacking. Used two .5s for start, don’t extend. Brought triples of .75-2. · Lead / Onsight. i’ll give you a kiss if you can get my #3 unstuck · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 hang in the bottom section- hard to sow it up and be comfortable · Lead / Redpoint. Totally clean red point! Beta for next time: 1. get gear into layback as quick as possible and go for it, don’t spend time messing with the gear or waiting, you’ll burn out 2. For transition, gotta get the right foot in the right place, as high as possible on the big foothold, kinda of near slung boulder Gear used: .4 yellow totem on layback .5 purple totem as high as possible before committing to layback .2 black totem after layback 3 blue BD before transition 60cm sling to the slung boulder .5 purple BD on the diagonal crack leading into big crack 2 yellow BD at beginning of hand crack 1 red totem midway up hand crack 1 red BD 3/4 up hand crack .3 blue totem in chockstone, 4/5 up hand crack · Lead / Flash. Got it! Pretty cruiser now which feels nice. No gloves is the move. · Lead / Onsight. Such a fun lead. Felt comfortable and well protected. Triples of 2’s, triples of 1s, double of 3s, otherwise a single rack. I climbed the wider crack on lookers right around the arete. Noted on MP as the start of the 11b even Stephen, which goes at 5.8. The finger crack at the bottom was fun but hard for me, high feet · Lead / Redpoint. Second run up with belay device to bring up Brian and then single strand rap to avoid weighing coreshot in rope · Lead / Redpoint. First 5.8-5.9 lead on granite trad!! Tronsight first from the 5.8 start and then led clean. We top roped the original start, the layback would be a scary lead due to potential for decking. Beautiful hand crack up top. Placed .5-3, could have done without the .5 though. Would bring 3 #3s for the 5.8 start and then 1s and 2s for the top crack with .75 in between. · Lead / Redpoint. Alternative start. Fun. Takes 1s and 2s up top. Sarah led clean!! First granite trad 5.9!. · Lead / Flash. Lay back was powerful. Thought the step left was a bit consequential if I were to fall. Don't fall there. · TR. A fun messaround. Lieback start was exhausting and I did it in like 6 hangs. I did some funky reverse dihedral and lieback moves instead of actually jamming most of the hand crack at the top. But we climbed it! · Lead / Redpoint. So fun. Blew the on-site attempt at low crux then redid the boi. · Lead / Redpoint. Step over felt fine this time. Put my foot on a lower step and then reached higher to the crimp after step over. So much fun. Finger crack felt secure. · Lead / Redpoint. Fell on my first piece at the top of the layback crux. Sent from the ground on the second try."

Throw your headlamp, hand jamies, puffy jacket, and maybe a knee pad into your pack then embark on the grueling approach to inner walls.This unique route climbs horizontally (and down) out of the mega cave just past “Tang”.  Begin standing on a small rock in the back of the cave and reach up to the first goodish hand jam. The first 15-20 feet are the crux but don’t let your guard down yet! A few tricky sequences remain in between sections of hanging stem box and horizontal chimney climbing.As of publishing this, dedicated route anchors don’t exist. I finished the FFA by climbing to a restful stem/stance about 10 feet up past the lip of the cave. From here, it’s easy enough to down-climb or down aid a few feet to the first bolt of Tang and lower from there.Obviously the route must be reclimbed (easier to reverse than to follow) to clean.Rock is surprisingly clean and solid but does seep a bit at the start. Doesn’t affect the climbing as much as one would think.Grit, Torque, TrainTruck!",

Did most of the moves but spend a long time hanging on the rope. dang hard · Lead / Redpoint. With Letty and Michael. Sew it up with #0.1, blue ballnut, red ballnut, #0, blue alien, yellow alien, #0.5, black totem, red alien, #0.75. · TR. TRS, almost clean, got past the crux but then got real tired and stopped using my feet. · TR. Getting established into stemming position is quite hard; otherwise quite doable as there are descent finger cracks after beginning · TR. TR send! Felt easier. Put left hand in first crack instead of right. · Lead. TRonsight then decided it was worth sussing out gear and was happy with blue ballnut enough to lead! · TR. Wtf, this is a 10?! Got a birthday belay all the way up · TR. 1 hang... might lead it after getting a bit more acquainted with the weird moves on this, though · TR. So fun! Easy to set up on TR from toxic or the 5.8 · TR. TR, tons of falls. Got a lot easier once I started to stem lol. Try again some time, really cool · TR. Hung once. So much easier than in November. Shea got it in two as well. · TR. Sent all moves. Just gotta link em up now. To start, left hand in slot and right palm on wall (gaston?), left foot up first, then kick up high right. Move left hand up to surface. It get’s cloudy from here… but either move feet higher to get undercling, or go for undercling right away, then adjust feet. Forgot the next moves… eventually, from a high right smear and good hands, kick up left foot to positive surface. Move both feet up this surface, press both hands right(?), to gain leftmost nubbin edge. Smear right foot on face, pull on slot with left to transition inti chimneying. Chimney left, watching for wet rock behind until large slot can be gained. Movement gets easier until mantel left for anchors. · TR. Heinous (complimentary). Just need micronuts, a weed whacker, and 10,000 calf raises per day before I lead it · TR. A few takes but seems within range on TR. First half was a grind but once you gain the crack the climbing is great. · TR. tried the moves down low. made it 15' to the first full handhold. didn't throw since left index finger is on the mend. would come back to work it out. · TR. Felt impossible at first but once I got moving it was decently secure. Super burly. Trying this on lead with the available spots for gear scares me · TR. Pretty struggle at the first half. Stem. Some offwidth techniques. Be patient. Maybe have a right foot knee protection is good. Some finger lock in the middle. · TR. Much more chill with chimney technique. Would be down to lead with some bigger rps and maybe a crash pad · TR. Worked this on TR. didn’t get it clean. climbed it left facing, not as bad as it looks, not sure how you are supposed to lead it though. · TR. Someone has to show me that 5.10d beta. Hah I got bullied on this! · TR. This was desperate as all hell. Hung all over it and was the closest I will ever be to doing the splits. · TR. Couldn't even get off the ground lol. Pulled through to a stance and struggled to the top. · TR. lots of slipping, but I did do some moves... Hopefully my body learned something · TR. Crazy sandbagged I felt. Felt way harder than Even Steven. Did not stem but climbed the crack instead. · TR. W Anthony Couple falls down low while figuring out beta. After the side crimps in the corner, a few moves of chimney climbing before going back to stemming. Start: avoid using the block · TR. A test of Granite IQ. Those well versed in shoulder scums, foot changes, hand foot matching / momentum will prevail. Did not lead after cratering a few years back. Makes a stellar top rope for those wanting to put it ALL together. · TR. So hard. I could start easily enough, then linking moves became manageable albeit strenuous, but I could not get past the rock bulge. Maybe try transitioning to a full stem, square hips. Great practice. Hard! · TR. Hard ass, wet stemming. Couldn't stick the lieback move at the beginning because it was so wet. · TR. Super polished in a corner, struggled with the beginning. Gets better up too with some finger cracks · TR. almost trash top rope flash a half fall not fully weighting the rope · TR. 6th pitch of the day, fell a few times, super great stemming practice · TR. clean onsight. hard, improbable climbing to gain the first finger-sized crack. actually climbs very beautifully. · Lead / Redpoint. Did once on TR to sus the moves and gear. Ended up not needing any nuts. Just boulder 15’ up to that first bomber .2 placement. · TR. Took once and fell once at the crux (for me) down low, which was trying to reach the bomber finger jam and transition from stemming to being in the crack proper. Superb movement; I was transitioning from stemming to both feet on the left and both hands on the right to inch myself up. Need to get my left foot as far in on the left edges as possible to be able to reach for the finger jam. Awesome. (HS) · TR. sweet climb, I need to get better at stemming with my feet. I used lots of hands and didn't rely on feet as much as I should."

Felt easier than “toxic shock” or “princely ambitions”. Comparable to “behind the tombstone”. · Follow. Fell once near the second bolt. This climb starts with a trad section which is chill, then moves into a bolted section which has a bit of a tricky sequence. Then into another chill trad section · Lead / Flash. Max and Haley lead. Stemmy to start. Then the slabby/sport bolted section, followed by an awesome flake. So fun. Soft for index. · Lead / Redpoint. Soo good!! Placed a black totem, .3, .4, .75, 3 and draws"

Huge flake, nudged body in the crack, mossy toes. Crux was at 4th bolt! · Lead / Flash. Can get 0.4/0.5 C4 in horizontal at top of flake to protect b/w bolts if wanted. · Lead / Onsight. Good route. Interesting if a bit awkward in places. Could use a .5-.75 plus sling for extra pro. · Lead / Onsight. Fun sport and seems good to do if waiting for another route. · Lead / Redpoint. My second time on this. It felt much smoother this time around. · Lead / Onsight. On site. No beta. Awesome route and fun lead. Plugged on .75 Camelot after the top of the flake. · Lead / Onsight. caught doug on the way out with a leaf blower, told us to climb this route he just put up!"

Painful through the meat of the route, but ultimately pretty fun. 4 to 3 to 2 at the top for sizing · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hands aren’t big enough for fists. Butterfly and stacks were rough down low. Eases up the higher you get. · Lead / Redpoint. Straightforward crack climb. Singles to #4 except maybe two #2s. Place a #2 at the first difficulty. Place a #4 as high as you can in the “hand crack”. Walk the 4 up as high as you can stem, then commit to jams in the crack. Can sew it up with a #3 then #2 or possibly #1 at the top of the crack. · Lead / Onsight. A little tricky at the fours but good fists than I’m in · Lead / Redpoint. Had some trouble figuring out the wide part but once I got my chimney system dialed it was all good · TR. Ilja, Ksenia, Haley and max trd. The two shorties had to cheat and go left at crux. · Lead / Onsight. Great wide practice! A couple heel-toes get you through the bottom. Big hands, so I had fists pretty much right away which made it easier. · Lead / Onsight. Fun. Nice wide-ish crack. AL effortlessly chimneyed the whole flare, lol (AL+) · Lead / Redpoint. Felt a little harder on lead but not significantly so. Definitely want a #4 to bump through the bottom flared section. Two #3s helpful, one for pulling through the bottom pre chimney crack section, one for in the flared chimney. · Follow. Clean follow. Started on broken cracks furthest to the right of start options. Nice little squeeze chimney/chimney warmup. Continued up into main flaring chimney. Faced away from main wall. Squeeze chimney technique (knee into wall plus pressing against opposite wall) on left (narrower) side of the body to rest, upwards progress using more strenuous foot counter pressure with right hand on same side as back on right side of body. Probably would just barely allow for placing gear in the crack? · Lead / Redpoint. First Index .9 lead - sweet. Wasn’t as pretty/ smooth/ elegant as I wanted but whatever; start was most difficult part, followed by stepping on the rope while door jamming. Index is cool · TR. was able to get fists when stepping off the flake into the corner, then it narrows to hands, kinda get stuck in the corner at the upper section, shoulders jammed in. surprisingly secure but it might be awkward with pro and rope in the crack. ii was straight in, maybe better to have left in and face right? · TR. wasn't able to use the crack in chimney and I used the arete instead · Lead / Flash. #4 very good to have. was able to get fists in pretty early. \"shoulder jam\" · TR. This route was tricky! I had never done a chimney before. Had to have some help (a boost) from my belayer at one part out of the chimney. It was fun though. I faced right while going up the chimney. I think? With mullet Andrew · Lead / Onsight. Pretty fun gruntfest, if a bit short. Takes doubles in 2-4. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung at the first butterfly move but should’ve kept going b/c it turns to fists real quick · Lead / Onsight. Great climb! Rock is super soft. I didn't even need tape. · Lead / Onsight. #4, #2 or 3, #2 for whole route. stacked at start of chimney then went up by jamming shoulders in flare · Lead / Fell/Hung. try chimneying whole way, or hand stack + knee or to get feet up better. · Lead / Onsight. #1 off the deck for Jesus, then green Tot. Crux crack 2x#4 but 2nd was tight, 1x#3, 1x#2, yel & blu Totem coming out of slot, red Tot before chains. Could do another #2&3 in main crack, maybe a low #5. Awesome!!! · Lead / Fell/Hung. So glad I went for the lead! 5-4-3-2. Had trouble getting from the stem into the crack and hung at the 4 to reorient the scum. · Lead / Onsight. Awesome climb! Crack definitely isint a hand crack the whole way. Offwidth to fists yo hands for my medium size hands · Lead / Flash. super fun. starts at butterfly stacks, narrows down to hands at the end. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Pulled on gear to get through the chimney, struggling with the \"hand crack\" · Follow. baffled and humbled by Rick's lead on the off width chimney section of this one. More off width technique needed · TR. Clean TR. Only did one fist jam move, mostly chimneying and kneebaring. Want to lead · Lead / Flash. Walk far left before the crack in the offwidth. Get your foot in and trust it then go up for wobbly fists. It gets better quickly. 4,4,3,3,2 for the crack. .75 for the root · TR. Great climb! Can stem off feature to get above the wide hands part of crack. · Lead / Onsight. Tipped out #3 was a bit unsettling protection for the first 1/3rd of the crack. Bring a #4 and 2 #3s · Lead / Onsight. Singles .5-2 doubles of #3 and a #4 will get the job done · Follow. With Hank. Clean. Forsook the crack for a bit and just chimneyed up a lot."

Incredibly fun on top rope, perhaps the most fun I’ve had at index, trust the slopers, they will hold you. · TR. Tricky start w/ long reach to a mono on not great feet. Beta intense middle crux, move LEFT to ledge for rest, don't go UP from the pinch/sloper, fell there a few times. Clean from ledge thru upper crux to chains, mantle painful on left fingers stuck in horizontal jam. · TR. took a long time to figure out the crux but really enjoyed the process - much technique · TR. Sooo fun. One of the best routes I’ve climbed. Fell a few times at the crux and also below the anchor (I think due to pump!). Would love to try again on TR. · TR. TR flash. Really fun thoughtful climbing with good holds where you need them. Would be a spooky but prb safe lead · Lead / Fell/Hung. finally nutted up and led this johnson after numerous top rope burns. tested the .2 mid crux and its bomb. feeling confident to RP in the coming week. · TR. figured out the beta on the proper line, gonna give it a lead burn soon. also found new gear beta that comes in clutch. · TR. Super major struggle for me, but a pretty cool route nonetheless! Set a top rope after leading Corner Flash next to it. I left some blood on the route, and stepped on the piton to cheat up the crux. Even if I was a stronger climber, this would be terrible to lead, infrequent & small pro opportunities. · Lead / Redpoint. .2, .2, yellow totem, yellow totem, purple totem, purple totem, black totem · Lead / Redpoint. 1 TR to suss gear then sent first lead go @ comp. Stellar w/excellent gear. Not PG13 if you have the gear dialed. Gear: Purple small metolius, x2 blue totems, x2 purple 0.5s, clip the piton, black totem. Run it out to the chains after that. · Lead / Onsight. Reminded me of the climbing back home. Not PG at all. Gear abounds and the smallest piece needed is only a .2. · TR. Took few times. Start right hand, others beta left hand finger lock? I moved left a bit, then seemed better. Then lean left, some holds, then back to right. Then look some good holds around the corner. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Ground up, but fell trying to avoid ledge. Bailed after broke totem. · TR. Straight up moves at ledge are fun, but but you still wind up just above it and it's contrived to not step down. · TR. Patrick hung a rope and had his first top rope send! I followed and slipped off on the mega right hand cross into the pinky down lock right before the chains. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Last move feels very insecure above the pin spooky for the on-site · TR. lots of small gear from 0 to .3, trickery crimps and undecling traverses. · TR. TR soloed. The crux felt like the last moves. Everything else was chill, just beta intensive. · TR. Felt pretty manageable on TR. One hung with some bad beta.. keep moving left down low. Red point crux would certainty be the top moves. · TR. Fell once at top crux. Tried to climb straight up instead of liebacking the sloper. · TR. need to practice gear placement, then try to lead. felt slightly easier than upper crux of slow children, so 10c? · Lead / Redpoint. this one felt good! with Alana and Dave 3x Send Train baby! · Lead / Redpoint. 2 TR burns (one for move beta, one for gear beta) then sent on first lead go. Got sprayed down by Alana and Hank which helped a bunch down low. Blue totem felt mandatory for the second piece · TR. Awesome climb. TR only, unless you have something to prove. First pro is a small cam (blue #1 or yellow #2 mastercam). Potential broken leg fall if you don't get that first piece clipped. · TR. Fun but hard. Couldn’t figure out crux up top. Then Aimee just waltzed up!! Wut. · TR. The bottom where it starts horizontal and curves up left was tough for me. Sustained in power on slab feet makes it a little scary. Up top I did the crux in one go! · Tr. gear is better than it looks from ground would be scary to OS tho! · TR. First crux: wide pinch and tiny fingertip slot Second crux (piton): layback on tiny flake, high toe over piton · TR. Work way around to left with balancey moves. Use thumb of right hand and go up to rail on left side · Lead / Redpoint. Gear is super solid and right where you need it. Having smaller offset for the start is super nice."

Bring #5 next time and stay in the wide crack! · Lead. Good warmup but wouldn’t be my top rec for a first trad lead · Lead / Flash. I heard it was better than Klahanie ;) Definitely more varied and I would say tricker, I think I’m with Stamati on this one · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took twice. Didn’t need to. Did it on TR after clean · Lead / Onsight. My third trad lead, a proud onsight! Got a bit spooked in the middle figuring out the fist jams, ended up just shoving my whole arm in the crack and going up · Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Brian. Good start, but wide in the middle. Powered through with bad technique in the off width. Started with a #2 or 3. Next piece was a #1 in the back of the crack. Once through the crack, climb our on the face with good mid-size gear (.5 and .75). TR multiple times. · Lead / Onsight. The route is cruising, except two moves getting over the wide crack are quite struggling, roughly #4 BD size. The pro is good. · Lead / Flash. Nice and flow-y, climbed the face instead of the off-width and it was way easier · Lead / Flash. Big gear 1”-5”. Doubles 2”-4” maybe. And single rack of med-small. No nuts needed · Lead / Onsight. First trad lead, probably dumb and dangerous, probably undercammed. Definitely got very scared · Lead. Warmup with Lindsey, wished I had the 4 but just fired through anyways · Lead / Onsight. Off width section was tough mentally, should’ve brought bigger gear FS but also some .5s would’ve been nice to feel extra safe · TR. Could lead, would want big gear. way to set up TR on agent orange · Lead / Onsight. Fun warmup after being out of the game. Bottom super fun into a tricky crux (for 5.7). · TR. Too wide for fists before the face climbing option started. Had a little breakdown about it. After getting pulled past that, the rest is super easy · Lead / Redpoint. w Brian. Bump a #2 at the start, then use a 3 or a 4 a little higher for the crux. Then use a 3 and either place a 5 or find a small placement on right, or climb higher and slung the chockstone. My minimum gear would be #2, #4, #3, double sling. Could swap a 3 for a 4 if needed · TR. Climbed with Clemo - bit of a grunt fest but short with wide jams · Lead / Flash. Clean lead. I’m sure I led it before, but don’t remember. Hard for a 5.7, 5.8 would have better set my expectations. I used singles #0.4 to #5 & a second #3, no nuts. A less experienced crack climber would want doubles of a few more sizes, even a second #4 could be nice-to-have. This route would be harder for someone with small hands, as wide fist-jams were key for me. Fun route! · 2 pitches. Lead. One take, poor .75 placement cost the clean send. Too much faffing with it, should have made the move. Caught the rope end on the chock twice when cleaning. · Lead / Onsight. Really the third time I've done it but apparently didn't tick before · Lead / Redpoint. Rope got stuck pulling after rappel! Had to re-climb. Next time should pull from the far left to avoid. One of the parties after us also got rope stuck in the same way. · Lead / Redpoint. warmup for Golden Bucket. More fun the second time. Probably tricky for less experienced climbers, but really fun. Placed 3 pieces. · Lead. Really fun. Dodged the upper offwidth and did the mellow face on the top right. · Lead. Pinkpoint but had to take once at the start of the fists. First half was tricky for me second half is super easy. Was helpful to have a #4 for the first half · Lead / Fell/Hung. So fun! Better than the Columns. Opposite side of Toxic Shock · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung halfway to check on a piece. Can do cleanly for sure · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell during a tricky fist jam, that move made the route feel 5.8+ to me but that might be from my thin hands"

Start up the Dark Crystal (Seasonally wet, usually dries in early June), climb to where the original route breaks left. Instead, climb straight up, clip a bolt and pull the roof. A couple boulder moves lead to a pumpy hand traverse. Save a hand size piece of gear for the end.P3 5.10: Climb the short tricky arête of the Dark Crystal. This could easily be linked into P4.P4 5.12- (5.10+ A0): The pitch of eternal sadness. Break right from the ledge into a shallow right facing dihedral. After a somewhat moderate start, a short but devastatingly granite crux, followed by more easy climbing brings you into the Dihedral.P5 5.11-: Dubbed the Book of Earth Mother, this pitch offers some of the best corner climbing Index has to offer. Perfect.P6 5.11d: If the corner didn't get you giddy, this slightly overhung 40 meter pitch leads up the glorious Zebra Headwall. Discontinuous cracks, jugs, and a sloper crux is sure to grab your attention.P7 5.0: Move belay up and right to the next anchor.P8 5.11: Climb steep rock to a slab crux. Continue up the slab and pull the fat roof on sexy slopers.P9 5.9: Fun climbing top's you out on the highest point of The Diamond.\"Just remember love is life and hate is living death.

The bolts that head straight up from the middle of P1 do not appear to get much (any?) traffic anymore. Pitches 2 and 4 are cool. One 70M does get you down, a 60M will not reach the ground on P1 but two ropes definitely not needed if you have a 70. Oct 5, 2015",

Single from very small to 4 and double 0.5-3 is accurate. Nuts and ball nuts useless. Very nice to have small totems for the p4 traverse pitch · Lead / Fell/Hung. Blew the dumb “boulder move” on p2 - wasn’t warmed up. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead evens. With Wayne. Took on p2 boulder problem, p4 traverse because I couldn't figure out to stay high or low. · Lead. Led every pitch. So fuckin fun. W cectruck <3. 2x .5-2. 1x.2-4x. Maybe a second .3. P4 and 5 are an easy link. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led P2, 3 & 6. Hung a few times but felt better than last year. · I led p1, Zach 2&3, me 4&5 zach 6 me 7. Fully clean except for pulled a bolt on p2 and to get into the traverse on p4. Soooooo good · 5 pitches. Lead. led p2 and p4. P3 gear is 0.3 to 0.75 until the roof which is awesome. hand crack after is mostly layback-y and hard to see gear. p4 traverse is real spooky. all gear 0.75 and smaller, offset cams were nice to have. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Excellent route! Led odds. Fell leading P3, P7, and following P2, P6. P3 and P7 falls were due to me wasting too much energy trying to rest on not-restful jams, P2 and P6 falls were tough boulder problems. Each tough section was only one or two falls though, no real stopper crux. Happy I got on it and didn't chicken out, it was an amazing climb. Super varied and almost every pitch had something fun. · 3 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. I led the first 3 pitches. Befuddled by the crux on P2--feels significantly stouter than 10+ but is short bouldery sequence. Much more stoked to send the ceaseless mega physical corner+roof of P3. · Lead / Redpoint. First time on the climb - definitely harder than 5.10d being short. Leads : 2 (5.11 moves if you can’t span) 3, 5, 7 Follow : 1, 4 (slipped here on opening move but lowered to cave and went clean) 6 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led pitches 1,5, and 6. Whipped on 5 when lichen-ey hold crumbled. Had to hang on 6. · Lead. Climbed with Cameron. P3 was tough for me. Super sustaining two roofs and lots of liebacking/placing gear blind. I thought every pitch was awesome but P7 might be my favorite. In the short list with my favorite climb at Index · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead 1+2 (would not recommend linking), 4, and 7. Pulled in some draws, definitely wanna go back and send this route when I’m less beat and the sun isn’t beaming down as much. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Sick day out with Ato. Grabbed a draw on P2 and hung on P3. Awesome climbing · Lead. lead p1, 3, 5, 7. Felt like a long long climb, largely due to that pitch 3. Big endurance challenge to keep it together for that monster of a pitch. Incredible variety, every pitch was a different style. P2 much harder than the others though. · Lead / Fell/Hung. P2 - fell/did the move clean. p3 - led. foot slipped and fell. got pumped and took. p6 - couldn't do the cryptic move. p7 - fell on the second roof/ did the move clean. · 5 pitches. Follow. Jeff said only 5 were on the route and it was going to rain. If I knew how to climb cracks better the couple bits of sport would be the crux. beauty of a climb. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Great route, climbed bad, had fun. With Mike, I led evens. · Follow. With Mike. Took on the 3rd pitch. Amazing exposure. Gotta go back and lead the corner and also the traversing pitch. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led evens +7 with Casey. Super fun. Several lead falls. P6 start was hard for me · Follow. followed vinny up this, it was so fucking sick. he onsighted every pitch, i flailed a ton but got a lot of exposure therapy. absolutely rad piece of rock. definitely want to come back and do it clean. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took the harder variation on pitch two and fell. sent everything else. awesome route! · Lead / Onsight. With Harry! A little dirty but some quality climbing. Worth doing the two top pitches · Lead / Onsight. great route! area was completely dry. did it in 4 hours from base back down to base. climbed with Jason. · Lead / Fell/Hung. swung leads with teddy. this is a contender for best 5.10 multi pitch at index/ the world!!! · 3 pitches. Follow. led p1, follow 2-3. worked p2 crux w kate. p3 was toughhhh. many shenanigans on this one · Lead / Fell/Hung. Somewhat forgettable first two pitches leads to arching crack and amazing face climbing on pinch blobs. Fell once at p2 crux for a nice wakeup. Crux @ start of p6. Almost all bolted after p3 makes for a speedy route · Lead / Redpoint. Climbed for the 4th time today with Maiza. Led all but pitch one. No falls, clean and very enjoyable day out · Lead / Onsight. os p3/5/6, Follow p1/2/4/7 clean. sweet, lots of variety and short pitches in general. up and down in 5 hours total with lunch break · Lead. Led odds, P3 was so awesome and P7 was cool too. Followed Sam on P2 and I fell at the crux moves · Lead. with Jacob..super fun route. led 2 (dog, did all moves. crux? 5.9 in book), 4 (clean..bouldery then fun traverse), 6 (fell at 2nd bolt 2x then found key left footer, fell higher using sucker high left..stay right). adventure top out to rap Sabra/centerfold). 3 is money pitch.. layback w/ percise feet on face. doubles to 3, single 4 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung on first bolt of p6, but rest onsight. Stellar climb! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead P1, P3 (fell), P5, P7. Fell following P2. With Jacob. · Lead. Bailed off the top of pitch three due to temps and humidity straight out of hell. · Lead. had to take on the 3rd pitch, skipped p2 for the bolts out right, added in glory hole at the top · 5 pitches. broke off to black radish, followed black radish and swung leads on HBG · Lead / Onsight. Did the first 5 pitches and then the last pitch of black radish (by accident). Lovely morning with Bailey. Excellent climb · Lead. Great route by why are there so many bolts next to great protection points on pitch 7. Someone should go up there and chop em. I think only like three of the bolts are necessary. · 3 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. led p2 & 3. hung on 2 but did all the moves. bailed after 3 cuz it was HOT!! · Lead / Onsight. W/ Gabe. P3 is “Glory” crack climbing and laybacking. It doesn’t get much better than this. · 6 pitches. Lead. Beautiful day november 18th. Will have to come back for the last pitch next time...or Sabbra! · Lead. Not sure on the date but it was October 2018. This is one of my favorite routes at Index.P2-5:-) · Lead / Redpoint. Climbed w/ Danny 4.5 hours, no pack. great climb! fell 1st move 1st try out of alcove. sent after that. · 6 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Lead 2,4,6 os. Rapped after pitch 6. Really good route. · 5 pitches. Fun mix of crack and face climbing. Traverse was airy and fun! · Lead / Fell/Hung. swung leads with Alex, took 1/3/5/7. did the dike fight for p2. 7th pitch was sick! · Follow. led p 1, followed Brian after. Stellar rock climb, the position on the wall is fantastic! · Lead even # pitches. p2 is wtf, p4 clean. p6 one hang at 1st bolt."

Linking this with Planet Caravan or Man in the Box on the Duck will be sure to not leave you wanting!

The route is climbable year round.P1 5.6 : Climb the first pitch of Hell Bent for Glory.P2 Most likely harder then 5.10+: Continue the first 15 ft of Hell Bent's 2nd pitch, break left at the bolt line. Bolts/Gear.P3 5.11- : Above the belay, climb straight up to a traversing pitch of techy yet powerful climbing that leads to the base of the finger crack. Bolts/GearP4: 5.11- : Follow the long striking finger crack. Thin GearP5 5.10-: Start up the corner system and break right onto face climbing that leads to Eyelid Ledge. Bolts/GearP6 5.10+ : From the belay, follow a ramp and break through the left side of eyelid roof. Fun climbing on highly featured stone. One can skip the rap anchor and belay at the base of the corner on Lovely Lady Ledge. BoltsP7 5.9 : Climb the corner. Break right at the roof and belay atop of the slab.

Bring ballnuts for finger crack, gear is wonky. · 7 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. What a rig. One fall at the end of p3 and a couple hangs and falls at the end of p4. Demanding, spectacular climbing. With the best of climbing partners snake jones. Next time bring all the gear <= .2 for p4, can leave on anchor. 4 was moderately useful on p5. P8 very confusing in the dark. Pulled the roof to the right, transferred left, down climbed and bailed. · Lead. With matt michie! Did not send either 11 pitch unfortunately, two fell the 11- on lead and one fell the “finger crack” it’s a seam that pinches down and has MAYBE like one or two finger locks absolute tops · Lead. Led most of the pitches, fell on 2 and 3, which was the crux, and onsighted everything else. Lots of good belay stances but some loose blocks near the top and loose bolts at the beginning. Up and down in 5 hours 45 minutes, 5 raps with an 80. · 7 pitches. Lead. w/ Kurt. I led 2,5, and 7. fell following pitch 3/4 (we linked) · 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Stoked to onsight p2 despite mugginess. With Lars :) stoke was high until Lars almost died of anaphylaxis at the start of p3 after a brutal assault by a vespid. Cued up for redemption. · 6 pitches. Lead. 2nd slab pitch was wet, 3rd pitch was slightly wet, definitely still doable. · Lead / Onsight. Sent everything besides pitch 3 and 4. Crux shit is hard. Took a fat whip on a bomber .1 on pitch 4. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Swapped with Joe. P2 bolts to hand size, P3 bolts & 1 BD.5, P4 gear to 1 + 1 #3, P5 1 3&4 to bolts. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell once on the third pitch and a number of times trying to exit the finger crack pitch. That felt really hard. Got er done cleanly after that"

Getting to it has two variations: the left is slightly awkward 5.10 (make sure to backclean or extend the 3rd bolt protecting the traverse), the direct above is crimpy and awesome 5.11b.

David pointed out I should go left and I was able to piece it together (beta: right hand in side pull pocket, crimps (can't remember exact sequence), eventually left hand to slopey far left hold, then bump feet and go for better higher hold with right hand). Also fell at crux (beta: left hand on the last super good hold before slopers, high feet (I think right foot on the really good really high foot), right hand for first slopey thing, then left then right, now keep right on the good-ish shelf because the next sloper is bad. Keep it there till move feet up, *then* go for slopers and mantel. Still not home free from there but the rest is all very doable and not as tricky with good effort). · TR. Nice to get to try this one again the same day. Still fell at the crux, but that's because I wasn't being careful. Should have kept right had on that pretty-good diagonal shelf while I bumped feet before going for slopers. Next time... · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 fall at crux. Left foot popped right at the last possible moment · Lead / Fell/Hung. Flashed up to sloper then had to stick clip up. Hard and insecure! · TR. At crux, get left foot up to nub, right foot in corner, hands up to blocks eventually getting right hand to right block, right foot up to edge in face just right of crack, left foot out wide to ledge, left hand to first slopy crimp, right foot in to edge in crack, left hang up to better crimp, right foot uo to good ledge, right palm down on sloper, stand up, bring left foot in · Lead. Morning temp mid 40s, start at 8 am. Hands went numb immediately, very painful. Grabbed draw at top crux, next time just look down for better feet. · TR. 1st Crux at left block: high right hand, high left foot. Reach high right then left hand, high left foot then use nub on face to rock over. 2nd Crux at bulge: right side pull to left pinch, left under up. Walk right foot to side pull. Bump left foot, left hand crimp, match with right , high left foot then rail, match, bump right foot up. Crux 3: corner. Left pinch right side pull, high right foot, bump right hand up, high left foot, high left hand, rock over, high left foot, high hand, bump right over then get left hand on, right foot out on face , walk hands along sloper weight right foot the.n high left foot and step yp · Lead / Fell/Hung. Blew the onsight after pulling the crux. It should go next time. · Lead / Redpoint. Forgot how to index mantel for a second but remembered just in time lol · Lead / Fell/Hung. Damn! Foot popped right as I was starting the crux. Felt good otherwise, thought I had it. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Go straight up on the mantle and keep right foot to the right of the bolt. Tried three times and finished on cunning stunt. · Lead / Redpoint. 1 fall pre crux (corner compression moves). Mantle crux not bad at all. Sweet climb · Lead / Fell/Hung. Super good, fell a few times working out the crux and completely missed the left crimp. Managed to do the sloper mantle without it · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at the crux. Hot sweaty day so hopefully it would be easier with better conditions · Lead / Onsight. Unreal, so many cool moves and holds on this climb. So good I did it twice, just kidding, while pulling our rope somehow jiggered itself into an autolocking belay device using the two permadraws, looked something like this when I lead back up there (https://www.vdiffclimbing.com/carabiner-brake/) first ever for me... · Lead. Almost onsight! Did the mantle and then tried to clip and thought I’d fall so I grabbed the draw. Ugh. Quick take and then finished it! So close! · TR. First time I've done this in the direct sun where it felt very smooth · Lead / Fell/Hung. Jeez! Cool climbing, punted at the mantle many times in the sun. Got pooped on by a bird and then pulled the move · TR. Got up to crux sloper with no falls. New beta for sloper: grab it a bit further right than before, using slightly more positive spot on the pinky side (turn wrist slightly in the thumbs out direction). L foot on positive diagonal crimp works well for mantel move. · Follow. Few hangs, crux was wet, then hands were greasing off the mantle sloper. Cross R foot into toe jam at start of crux to avoid barn door, then left foot up on chip. · TR. Hung at upper crux, sloper rail got soaked in the light rain that started · TR. need to come back and lead! Super sick climbing, all the moves are chill, just need to link them · Lead / Redpoint. Project finally goes down!! Early birthday present from Index. Also had great vibes from Leah Salinsky and George Bieker (on belay) at the crag!! 10/10 would do again · TR. From CS intersection: L hand good pinch, R hand good side/undercling, feet up, L hand to slopey sidepull higher -> must keep L foot high for it, R hand deadpoint to worse side/undercling, L foot high to slopey ledge, R foot higher, L hand deadpoint to positive sidepull crimp. Then, work R foot into toejam and clip? Both hands on diagonal crimp, R hand first sloper, L hand second sloper, R hand on slopey ledge (find groove w/fingers). Feet up on bad feet, L hand on slopey crimp. Stand up and get R foot on bump below ledge (crux). Stand up on that and you're done. · Lead / Redpoint. First go but had tried a few seasons ago. Not hard · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Crux went with layback/mantle on right side - get foot high. Feels tenuous, condition dependent. · TR. Super fun route. Got through the first crux then tripped up on the slope-y ledges. Figured it out though and want to try it on lead! · Lead / Fell/Hung. whipped off the mantle a few times before getting it. gotta move right on the slopey rail then get the high left foot · TR. Fell at roof, didn’t realize there was a good crimp. 3ish hangs trying to figure out mantle. · TR. 1 hang on TR, could project. From where it meets CS left hand on big side pull, right hand undercling above CS flake. work feet up, go to positive side pull. then next positive crimp match, right hand small sloper, left hand better hold, right on mantle ledge. feet up, left foot on diagonal hold, spiral up on it right hand ledge left hand small crimp push with foot to stand up ending with left hip in wall. get right foot on small hold on arete and you're done · Lead / Redpoint. Dialed on TR then sent back to back with Mikey OC · TR. Clean up to sloper moves, which felt hard after settling on some beta. · Lead / Onsight. mmmm sporty and juggy <3 feels true to the grade, despite being quite soft by Index standards · Follow. Conceivably leadable due to close bolting, although mantle off the sloper really sucks. lf intermediate and hop up? In lower slopers go left first then high feet. Higher up, l crack sidepull, higher r crack sidepull, bump to good l sidepull always with good feet · Lead / Fell/Hung. One take and one fall at the crux. So fun, could rp for sure. Use those tiny crimps!! · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Hella whips w/ Kiera :) Better second time on TR · Lead / Fell/Hung. Tried a few times since the draws were hung. Fell a couple times then lowered · TR. TR’d from top of cunning stunt. Cool but crux is pumpy and short"

Left hand crimp traverse. Rest. Followed by a right hand dead point. · TR. Clean! Some beta tips: before the stem bar thing step left on that slopey thing in order to clip. For the traversal left, just need to move quickly through small crimps, but I am strong enough to hold on to them just fine. For the upward right diagonal crux: take a good long rest, don't get sidetracked by the jug thing out left (I actually forgot about it during this burn which was a good thing). I can't remember the exact hand sequence I used, but just look at it and you'll figure it out. I liked what I did and think my brain could recreate it upon another look. It actually didn't feel bad at all. High left foot for sure though. Trust it... And for the love of god please try to lead it next time. The beta and strength are dialed.... · Lead / Fell/Hung. Finger pully kept me from finishing last two bolts but was stellar otherwise · TR. Amazing climb, quality rock, great movement. Crux for me before standard crux- getting the jug on the right of the traverse. Had to get feet stemmed high for left hand 3 finger ledge, bump right to bad left side of jug, then to the jug (now I know it’s there) · Lead / Flash. Ethan, Haley and max led. Great climb with some delicate movement through the crux. · w dees boys. soft 2nd. don’t use arete- commit to smol feet and it’s chillin. · Lead / Redpoint. w/ sam. so fun to repeat this! second 5.10 of the day · Lead / Fell/Hung. Huh, got stumped by the crux moves on the first go. · TR. Crux starts in blank corner. Walk left up left ramp, right foot high in corner. Left hand small crimp, right to rail. Walk feet up, left foot under clin, right side pull. Right foot small lip, left foot way out. Bump left two pockets, right to small pocket. Bump to left rail. Both feet over use left Gaston and right on rail. Right foot high left foot up to lip. Twist right hip in both hands to rail, left reach high to next rail, high feet and go! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took a bit to work out the beta. Great route. Would be a proud onsight. Used a .3 cam to supplement bolts. · Lead / Redpoint. SEND. Great route. Would repeat anytime. Liked having the .3 in addition to the draws. · TR. Interesting route, beta intensive moves. Really fun jugs on a flake with minimal feet. It’s a tough one but rewarding to get it. Crux for me was moving across the finger pockets, for others it is the next set of moving a getting to the flakey jug. · TR. Very doable, but got pumped on lead and switched off, need to work on my lead game! · Lead / Onsight. Through the extension, fun! Kept to the arete at the end · Lead / Onsight. Climbed this at night - so fun! Great route with an obvious crux. Last couple moves were tough for me too · Lead / Fell/Hung. One burn. First crux is confusing but not hard with the right beta. Second crux is straightforward but you actually have to be good. Barely avoided a wasp hiding in the crack after the second to last bolt. Wish I had tried for the redpoint but it was the end of the day. Also I managed to sprain my ankle on this route without noticing somehow??? Bizarre · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 fall on the reachy crux. Got it second time with higher foot position. Must come back for the redpoint. Best climb of the day. One of the bolts is too high and very reachy at 5'8 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Dammit.. fell at the first traverse crux. I did a foot swap that seemed to really work for next time · Lead / Fell/Hung. Unsent this from a few years back. Had to hang twice. Still rusty from offseason. · Lead / Fell/Hung. One hung, went right at 3rd bolt on onsight attempt. Very fun route · Lead / Flash. Got scared between the bolts but felt totally fine on the moves. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell once at middle crux. Spent 10 min right below the anchor trying to figure out how to reach jug. Traversed right with sketch slab moves to ascend. · Lead / Onsight. first climb in index! a little committing in spots, me and harrison both got spooked. relearning to trust sticky granite · Lead / Fell/Hung. Tricky and pretty spooky. Also got hot up on the face in the sun · Lead / Redpoint. part after traverse felt a bit hard to find the feet. spaced bolts"

I just really enjoyed the moves and had a total blast on it, even if I was flailing.

If TR by headlamp last time was a bad idea, leading by headlamp was even dumber. Made it to the second crux and almost stuck it before lowering off · 3 pitches. TR. Lead first lap in sun - stupid. TR lap x2 didn’t fall until second crux on both. Second TR lap that was the only time I fell - stuck LH triangle but fell bringing LF in. 64 degrees and 62% humidity on last attempt - not worth leading on anything higher than that. Crux 1 - LH good sidepull, RF high to good foot, crank up and RH to good corner to shift weight over foot. LF to thin corner and bring LH up. Match feet then LF up to good edge. Lean out right, RH spanned to opposing “corner” and bring RF up, LH to undercling flake, match - thumbdercling RH to left of LH, RF up to good indent on corner, LH on good corner, deadpoint RH to bottom of U, LF up, match LH right of RH, RH to jug. Crux 2 - LF heel hook ramp, LH kinda high sidepull but comfortable, RH bottom crimp sidepull, LH bump, RF to scoop, RH to triangle, LF to scoop just right of RF, RF high rose edge, LF toe top of ramp, LH throw to triangle, LF in to lighter crystally smear, RF pull with toes on sidepull crimp, RH to crimp then jug crimp Crux 3 - fridge hug to jug sidepull, then feet on hood edges/smears, LF heel to bump LH, RF heel LF good smear to get RH to crimp high in middle of fridge, bump LH, swap feet, stab LF to far edge, RH to good gaston on fridge left side to rock onto foot · TR. Didn’t make it past the 3rd bolt - super height dependent climb, don’t bother trying again · TR. Tall guy climb, figured out the moves and will come back to lead · TR. first time on it. feels impossible ATM first crux isn't clear need more work on the beta. · TR. Made it to like maybe bolt 3 lol. Too tired to figure out a beta that worked after that (also i may not be good enough to get past that part even with the right beta) · TR. When in doubt, lunge up right! First crux: delicate to fall right, crescent to lunge into R crimp. Second: meh R crescent to L corner, hard spread out w bad feet lunge into R crimp. Third: lieback w bad smears, lunge up to R crimp and traverse hard left · TR. Sussed. Three distinct cruxes involving shitty techy feet placements with rests in between · 3 pitches. TR. Figured out beta for everything, ready to lead. 1st go meh. 2nd go fell first crux traversing, then no falls to the anchor 3rd go fell once on 2nd crux. Make sure to use the worse right foot on the face when putting heel up. · 2 pitches. TR. 2nd go felt pretty good. First crux traverse low, iron cross middle 2 fingers each hand. Lh on 2nd crimp (is better), rh side pull above lh, Rf at highest good foot near ledge thing, lf on nubbin left of the vertical thing, rh up, · TR. Finally did all the moves “for real” climbing into and through the cruxes instead of preplacing feet when pulling back on. If conditions are good, time to start RP burns! 2nd crux right foot grey scoop, left foot grey scoop up left, RF rose edge, left toe arête & throw. Third crux - fridge hug, left hand jug, work feet to RH crimp, fight barn door and stab LF across to edge · Lead / Fell/Hung. Got the rite of passage smack down on this one… crux 1: move up w high RF and LF in corner, swing to match R hold, up small crimps. Crux 2: Move high L, bad smeary feet, R bump up bad, jump L into block, R crimp. Crux 3: hugging to barndoor transitions · 2 pitches. TR. 2x. First crux hit Index finger in bottom of U. Second crux finally stuck LH triangular block with RF good rose edge. Weird angling groove above toe down heel-toe cam. Third crux finally feels linkable · TR. this might be the hardest thing I've ever tried to climb-and I failed miserably · 2 pitches. TR. Tough conditions; no real progress today. 2nd crux still seems close to impossible. · TR. I had to pull through all three cruxes. The high temps and humidity certainly didn't play in my favor. I think I can get through each crux with some practice. The first and second crux seem easier than the third to me. · 3 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Twice made it clean to the second crux, which I still haven't figured out (so, so hard!). Getting to the last bolt was kinda scary! I think I could maybe get it, but it's going to take A LOT of work. · TR. Fantastic. Spectacular movement! I honestly wish it hadn't been so fun, b/c now I feel like I have to come project this thing. Lots of falls, but figured out all but 1 move on TR. Sooo good. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Had better conditions. DNF. Figured out first crux - go right, much easier. New high point at top of second crux, super cool movement, but blew tip and didn’t want to ruin skin more · Lead / Fell/Hung. Felt way out of my league. Had to pull though multiple cruxes. Clipping bolts was scary · TR. i got shut down. felt harder than stern, bcat cringe, and bat skins. · TR. Remember to get the left foot over as much as possible before bringing the right foot up below the bulge. Toe hook with left foot, sliding the hand up high is really key. Second crux is all about using the arete out far right, then a high foot left · 1st lead attempt on my 3rd sess. Great route! As 'my style' as them come. · Lead / Redpoint. With Keith. Wore spandex just for fun. Perfect granite route. Found beta for 5'8\" height. · Lead / Onsight. So we did this ground up. Kind of a unique approach it would appear nowadays."

Overall hard crux, but rest is easy flow. Happy to finally get it! · Lead / Fell/Hung. At 2nd bolt, RH side pull/under cling with RF counter pressure, almost like lieback. · Lead / Redpoint. Fun! Felt harder or at least as hard as kite flying blind. Fell at the first bolt twice before figuring out a bizarre challenging sequence to gain enough height to get to the next crimp. Lowered and then went to the top. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Crux felt balancy and out of reach. Not super inspiring but also was very tired · Lead / Flash.

One cruxy move; rest of route was straightforward. Used aid for the crux · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at second bolt. Knob where left foot rests popped off, delicate shift to high right foot. · Lead / Fell/Hung. fell once right before crux, should try again for clean ascent · Lead / Redpoint. An awesome project. Psyched to have found this fun entry to 11’s. My first 11 lead. · Lead / Pinkpoint. Go out right to chunky side pull on 2nd bolt.

Would be very hard if you aren’t comfortable with thin hands crack. · Lead / Redpoint. GM route with heart of country p3 variation. Follow p1, lead p2-3. Redpoint p2, took to shake out on p3 · Lead. I led first pitch, onsight. Devon onsight linked P2 and the HOTC 3rd pitch variation. TR send on P2/3. · 2 pitches. Lead. w/ Keira. Led P1. Move after bolt still feels committing for someone who is short! Linked w/ HOTC. · Follow. Followed through first two pitches with a fall coming out from the roof (bad feet) · Lead / Onsight. Lead 3rd pitch variation (10b/c). Butch lead 1 & 2. Would definitely do it again to lead P2, variation is awesome. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Did the original p3, 5.9 is a stout sandbag lol. Got bucked off by the section above the offwidth. Gonna do the beautiful handcrack next time like a normal person · Lead. Swapped w/Ryan on his first ever Index trip. Finished through HOTC. I lead P2, P4. We split the last pitch into two. · Lead / Onsight. Did P1/2 of GM into 10a start of P3 of Heart of the Country. I led P1 and P3. Partner struggled at the P2 roof, but it felt okay on follow (doesn't everything?). Think it would be a good lead for me for practice, not sure it would be worth the faff. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 5.9 was hard but doable. Could also lead 10b crack, would want a 3 or maybe even a 4 at the top · Lead / Flash. Sketchy scramble to P1 start anchor (from the right; next time try from the left, it may pe protectable? Or bring a crash pad for the direct boulder problem). Led P1, followed P2, led P3 of Heart of the Country (10b) · Lead / Onsight. Led pitches 2 and 3, top fist crack of pitch three felt much harder physically than any other 5.9 I’ve ever done, kind of a sandbag in my opinion but then again I’m not the most experienced in fists. Still great climbing all around and very awkward body positioning in general but I love a little bit of funk. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took once on third pitch. 3rd pitch felt way harder than heart of country 10b 3rd pitch. Definelty most sandbagged 5.9’s at index · TR. First top rope solo! Was a bit brutal, got quite tired by the time I made it to the nice hand crack at the top · Lead / Onsight. With the 5.10 third pitch! Felt so good, such a fantastic rock climb! · TR. Midnight full moon TRS at the solstice party! So funnn. A lovely goodbye to a great first trip · Lead / Flash. Led the first pitch. Wet and kind of scary. Followed the second and third pitch, did the 10 variation for the third pitch · 4 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. HOC finish. Approach from left, protectable. Aided P1 off bolt (stood in sling to place gear) spicy getting to bolt. Aided P2 through roof. 1 hung HOC pitches. Was glad to have a 4 & 5 · Lead / Onsight. Lead pitch one and two in one pitch fun finished on third pitch of heart od the country · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lots of hanging on the third pitch. Was off width just larger than fist jams. · Lead / Onsight. Linked pitches 2 and 3, did not send the unprotected 5.11 slab start. · 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Lead first pitch. Really not a fan of tricky slab moves right off a ledge with no pro… getting to the start also felt pretty sketch. Followed second pitch, very cool thuggy liebacking · 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. I led first pitch, Greg led the second. Didn’t do the third. · 2 pitches. Lead / Flash. P1 P2 led really fun. Partner took a massive whipper when the rope side biner somehow came off and was attached to the rope · 4 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Cool route, fun pitches, wide. All Ps are super short tho. Did it in 4, I led 2 and 4 (3.5), Freddie led 1, 3. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lead pitch 1 clean. Scary and committing move to the first bolt high off the deck but fought through the fear. Followed pitch 2 clean. One fall following pitch 3 towards top in sustained and wider hands section. · Lead. Came in from left to avoid wetness. 4 cam for 2nd pitch. Otherwise standard rack · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Led pitches 1-2 before following Andrew up p3 of HotC. Clean on p1, fell several times on p2, excellent pitch. Have the beta for next time (reach in to the right facing corner with right hand) · Lead / Fell/Hung. Followed 1 and 3. Fell and hung on 2. So fun. Will do again · Lead / Fell/Hung. Led pitch 1 and half the 3rd pitch of the 10b variation. Cam climbed the rest. The 10b pitch is awesome but I got very pumped. I need to get stronger. 2 #4 is great for the 2nd pitch, and I would have been happier with a 3rd #2 · Follow. Pitch 1: flashed Pitch 2: needed quick boost at the main start/overhung section Pitch 3: basically got boosted majority of the way up LOL · Lead / Fell/Hung. Ian lead P1, I lead P2 falling once slipped off a bad foot jam at the beginning of the crux, Ian lead p3, I fell following a bunch at the top fist crack · Lead / Fell/Hung. Take on final offwidth. Notes for myself. 2nd pitch - layback, jamming is quite hard. Finsl offwith on 3rd pitch - have 2 #4 and 1 #4.5. After passing the widening, final layback is easy. · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. first pitch only. nearly decked getting to the start....... a handline or something would be stellar · 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Led the first pitch and it was super chill, Emmett led the second and it was rowdy… had a few foot slips, a bit of dangling on the follow. Linked to the last pitch of Heart of the Country · TR. Almost TRonsighted the direct slab but greased off the top on what I think was probably the last droppable move (maybe not droppable if clean). Brush next time. Cold temps can’t hurt · Lead / Onsight. Two pitches and then the third pitch of heart of country with Charlie · Lead / Onsight. Approach to P1 a little sketchy. Worth roping up? P1 a bit balancy/tricky no pro until bolt. P2 used 2 4s. Be careful of placements and keeping follower tight since rope can run all the way into crack and push pieces in deeper. Fun roof looks scary and requires a few moves of layback but isn’t too bad. P3 hardest pitch, #5 squeeze/OW (challenging, slow progress) into large fists (slightly insecure, long) · Lead. Led p1, followed Brandon on p2. Brandon linked p2 with p3 of heart of the country. Fists were challenging! Did a take · Follow. Absolute carnage. Tiffany styled each pitch including 10.b crack. I climbed first pitch clean, 2nd pitch by aid climbing hanging on cams. Didn’t attempt 3rd and felt great about the effort. · Lead / Onsight. Brought doubles to #3, one #4. Placed zero nuts. Awesome route!!! · Fun, athletic. Single rack to 4 for first 2 pitches, 3rd pitch is broccoli 3-4 size crack with OW start. More fun to do heart of the country 10b for 3rd pitch m · With gen, led 2. A 4 at bottom of p2 but 5 not needed. Skip the third pitch altogether -absolute grovel fest and much harder than HOC, which is such a superb pitch. Def do that one. · Lead / Fell/Hung. lead p2, fell twice and ended up basically aiding the crux. P2 maybe crux but P3 very wide, very sustained, I was really tired and pulled on a lot of gear. this is a hard climb for a small person. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Use a #4 on wide section of P3 to reach a good fist jam above · Lead / Onsight. Heart of the country variation. Lead p1; follow p2-3. Clean follow · Lead / Fell/Hung. p2 fall, use the undercling next time and rack gear on left side · Lead / Onsight. led p1, followed the other two. hard climbing especially the last pitch! · Follow. led 2nd. which is probably the hardest of the 3 pitches. they are all proper index 5.9 fuck you hard. · 4 pitches. TR. Pitched out to the start of the climb. Climbed pitch 1 clean Fell on pitch 2 & 3 · 4 pitches. Lead / Onsight. roped up for the walk out to the initial anchor bolts. 5.8, 5.10, 5.9 imo nobody warned me about the offwidth part!! · 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Pawel and I did two pitches. He led the first and I followed, both clean. I one-hung the second pitch and followed. Got a bit spooked in the roof and needed to sort out my cam placement (higher!) and smeary deadlift strategy. · Lead. feltl really good this time. the second pitch went smooth. climbed with Saraphina. · Lead / Redpoint. lead second pitch. second and third can be combined with full double rack to 4 and a 5 · TR. Loose block inside left crack at top of first pitch. Heady beginning to second pitch! Very fun!!! · Lead / Flash. Did the 10b variation on pitch 3. Perfect hands there. Beautiful pitch 3. · Lead / Fell/Hung. P1 Lead: Ticky but easy. P2 Followed: flowed well. Use knobbs and lieback. P3 Lead and lowered. Very pumped. Will go when endurance is up. Rap. at top of first pitch, when rapelling, unintentionally forgot to personal in to bolts before undoing rap. Was distracted. remember to focus. 1. personal, 2. rappel devices. · Lead / Onsight. fun route. hand crack is too short. face climbing through wide section. · Lead / Onsight. Not sure if it was the lack of rest from surfing, the complete lack of sleep, and/or the lack of food, but this route felt hard. Need to go back when feeling better and see if it's a sandbag, lol (AL) · 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Led all the pitches with Zee. Did the HotC variation for last pitch. Great! No need for the 5 for me. 1 for was good. · Lead / Fell/Hung. fell leading p2. very burly/bouldery. want a #6 for p3 unless you're comfy on chimney. · Lead / Onsight. p1. sent no problem. p2. sent. ran out. pumped. wish I had another #4. didn't do the p3 or the variation. · Lead / Onsight. Lead the first pitch, Chris did the 2nd. Then we did Heart of the country · Lead / Fell/Hung. Last move! Gear beta for P2 and Heart of Country Crack: - 3 and 1 for pulling under roof - two 4’s for middle section - a few .3-.5 ish pieces for start of hand crack - .75, 1, two 2’s, and one 3 for hand crack · Follow. gm to hoc. p1 entry ledge traverse is bs with pine needles on the ledge. getting to the first bolt is also bs. a slip there would be real bad. stick clip? maybe I'm tired, but the whole route felt 5.10. · Linked 1&2. Did both hotc variation and standard finish. OW-fist p3 felt like the burliest on the climb. Single rack .2-6, double hand sizes, 4 alpine draws. · Lead. Lead P1, attempted lead P3 got up to #4 wide crack. P2 transition to crack was hard!"

That last bit seems less than 11a if you do it as a stand alone pitch. Seems like that entire full third pitch coming from GM is more like solid 10c. · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Did the 10a start of P3 after GM. Delightful. · 1 pitch. Lead. Led P3 after the first two pitches of the GM route. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Linked pitch one and two together. Onsight pitch one. Fell on knob low traverse pitch two sad. Flew into tree · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Climbed third pitch after doing p1 and p2 of Gm route. Might be my favorite pitch at Index! · 1 pitch. Followed Darwin on the final pitch of this after two pitches gm route · Lead / Fell/Hung. Very cool. Led all P. One silly but big (30’! Slab) fall on P1, but 4s crack is sick. Thought for sure I was off on P2 but held it together, did some insaneee sequence (back step+rose move!) on the final traverse. P3 is soooo classic, 2 amazing splitters. Great day out! · 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. Pitch 3 after doing first 2 of GM. Did the full pitch 3, last time I stopped at the first anchor because I was out of gear. · 1 pitch. Follow. Followed Andrew up p3. Super fun, clean follow, but at this stage couldn’t fathom placing the gear · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Linked GM route into the third pitch of this, and it was a very good pitch. Well-protected and fun climbing all the way through. Second pitch looked fun too · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Led P3 after the first two pitches of the GM route. · TR. lowered off the anchors to give the top pitch a shot. took once, it is sustained! · 1 pitch. Follow. just p3. fantastic splitter although it was quite clammy with the temp and humidity. Solid 5.10 seems about right for that pitch. maybe 10+ · 1 pitch. Follow. Aaron lead the 3rd pitch (we climbed the two pitches of GM first) Hard! Like Breakfast of Champions but did better. Actually made a couple crack climbing moves. Shuffle feet! · 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. With Vivienne, Star, and Zack. P3 only, linked with GM P2, to the lower anchor. · 1 pitch. Follow. Just the last 10b pitch as a finish to gm route. Didn’t love it, but see why people do. Too much jamming lol. Fell 3 maybe 2 times · Lead / Redpoint. Just pitch 3. Took at upper bulge. Want (3)2” cams for this pitch. So good. · Lead / Fell/Hung. P1 Big whip. Not sure I went the right way. Try again on a cooler day. Lots of ants and spiders. P2 cramping so downclimbed. Ran out of gear to do second crack on P3. Fun day but not quite what I was expecting! · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. linked 2nd pitch of GM Route into 3rd pitch of HoTC, no need for #4 or #5 · 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Only Pitch 3 as GM HOTC linkup. Everything you hope it is. · Lead / Onsight. Very cool line - more folks need to climb. P2 traverse was challenging - had to pull gear to get on ledge - awkward AF!!

First two pitches GM route then last (2) pitches of heart of the country · Lead / Fell/Hung. led p1&3 onsight with Will H. Fell on the 11b Crux traverse. higher looked easier to me... · TR. TR Solo. Don't recommend this route for TR soloing, Kept getting pulled off traverse. · Started on GM. Pitch three and four are tough but manageable. Third starts finger thing to thin hands. Try to save a two of you want to link three and four. Four is hand wide to thin. Super short. · Lead. Great route! Started on GM route (first two pitches). Three is the crux but both upper pitches are manageable. Three starts finger small and goes to thin hands. If linking three to four (suggested) save one two. Four is short and starts hands wide to t · 1 pitch. Follow. Only did last pitch after GM. Steve Yi Lead the pitches · Lead / Fell/Hung. Did P3 variation from GM Route. Had a take on the transition from hands to fist crack. Left hi foot · Follow. With Leslie. P3 only. Really hard for me - felt very insecure. Climbed clean but glad I didn't lead! · 1 pitch.

Lots of loose book sized blocks and a pond at the 2nd anchor · Lead / Redpoint. led all for Alissa, linked p2 and p3, could probably link all three with an 80m. TR the route climbers left of p3 anchors, fun exposed slab · Lead / Onsight. Multi with Sage & Fed! Lead pitch 1 and 3, Fed lead pitch 2. Great day out and got past some fear and had a great time on the flake! · Lead / Onsight. Mourning star felt stiff for a 5.8 , felt like I was going to slip out for the first 30’ established in the crack. Chimney was weird at first but pretty good overall , definitely no Butt Lips. P2 was good but be comfortable with runout sport or bring a few pieces .3 - 1” if you’d like. P3 was great! Super sticky sand papery granite. The start was reachy but easy to aid & step up into a good stance. Overall 3.2/4 · Lead / Flash. Led pitches 1 & 3, pitch three was some of the smoothest trad I’ve ever climbed · Lead. onsight p1 & p3, accidental did part of Hairway to Stephen as p2 (no falls, though) · Lead. With Dan. Lead P2 and P3. First pitch is tricky climbing and protection. · Follow. Josh led pitches 1 and 3 (trad). I led pitch 2(sport). Pitch 1 is challenging getting into the crack. Place extra gear. In the flake/chimney either left or right facing works. Skip the first anchor by the tree and go around the corner to the anchor. From the first anchor go up slightly left on the bolt line. · Lead / Flash. lead 1 & 3, with Darren. 1 had some spice, 3 was a fun romp after getting off the belay ledge. · Follow. follow on P1, P3. P2 lead was great, there were some moving blocks towards the end. will come back to lead all three or at least P3. · Lead / Onsight. Early season; P2 Dirty. Start of P3 harder than last time. Great climb! · Lead / Onsight. With Lia. Intro to multi pitch for her. Led all pitches · Lead / Onsight. very cool quartz on p2. p3 start seemed pretty hard for 5.7 · Lead / Onsight. Ken led the first and third pitches, then I led the second pitch that had 5 bolts, practicing placing gear between the bolts. · Lead / Onsight. Dag led p2 (first time placing gear on lead!), p3 super nice and flowy · Lead. Really fun route. Each pitch is different. Pitch 3 is superb. Double rack to 2”. · Lead / Onsight. Second two pitches are fun. The roof at the top of the second pitch is quite small and the belay ledge you’re going has a hole that collects water as we discovered. Crux is getting off the ledge but apparently there are crimps out left. · Led P1&3, follow Eric on P2 P2 is dirty, features an easy layback P3 went up the left face and over into the crack. Super fun! · Follow. First pitch is hard, but has good fingerlocks when you find them. Second pitch needs to be brushed, third pitch could use it too. Fun climbing overall. · Lead / Flash. Led p2 which was very dirty and had a spicy finish. · Lead / Flash. with justin and jenny. lead p2. bats in the cracks in p2! real ones! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Halfway up Morningstar foot popped off. Second and third pitch not in the guidebook."

Go right around the corner and toe hook to reach the 2 knobs? Lots of very insecure balancy slab climbing after · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. See 12/3 for permadraw crux beta. Now need to link it from the bottom. · Lead / Redpoint. Knobs! The 11- climbing to the higher anchor is very worthwhile. Style points for an added baggy hand jam, toe hook, and fingerlock. Be on the lookout for all three. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Crux at perma dry is low percentage for me. Stay low. Mantle up high needs work · TR. After Derrick's lead. Magical knobs. Down low layback and move feet up into small openings in crack with left hand on arete. Couldn't figure out how to gain the slab near the permadraw/chain - skipped after many attempts. Knobs above were dancey. Pistol squat with heel on the horizontal rail. · TR. Felt doable with crux coming in from right - want to prehang long draw from bolt above. High chimney, layback for bottom crux. Knob start also very fun but needs gear. Clip chain, traverse right from first ledge. At crux: L hand bump to upper knob, R foot toehook, R hand to lower knob, L hand to far knob, be strong and match feet. L foot up to shelf on crystal, stand up to L crimp. Upper knobs are also sequency but easier. · TR. Traversed low below chain draw to small arete- couldn’t figure out crux any other way. Crossed hands on nubs above sloper rail, got a good and hidden left foot on smallllll nubbin on sloper rail · Lead / Redpoint. Sent to the second anchor in a session after having tried it once last year. · TR. hard start, cryptic moves on knobs, more thoughtful leg press moves on knobs. feet hurt./ With Anthony · TR. Not really a tick lol. Struggled and huffed and got assisted to below the mantle crux. Didn't get above it. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Worked on the 12a variation instead of bushwhacking to the 11d anchor. 12a is much nicer. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Go right at hook, up is a lie. If this is index 11d I feel pretty good about rehab · Lead / Fell/Hung. Lots of work. First three bolts dialed. Crux is weird friction and the knobs after it are not my style. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Couldn't figure out crux at perma. First crux is savage laybacking/palm pressing. · Lead. Back to the perma draw to work that funk part. No real progress · 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Sent second try today. Fairly hot and sweaty but good enough to get it done despite messing up the crux beta. To middle chains · TR. More fun for the shorties. Hand foot match to press to dyno!!! Way to end off the day. Turns out the crew doesn’t normally just put up a bunch of 11s. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Bailed off the perma draw. Really cool slab problem there that I wanna try when it’s in the shade · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. One hang! Lh lf rh rf, rock over (squeeze), up into undercling, clip. Lh crimp, lf stem, rh press, rf knob, rh cross to crimp, lf to big knob, crank up, stay low, go right to side pull, lf to closer higher knob, press up, clip. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Climbed to the crux, above the chained draw. It was really difficult, ended up lowering off the draw. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Beta for opening sequence was a Dyno to the jug. Mantle at the Permadraw feels impossible when hot and muggy. · TR. Rh arete, lh up to knob, lf knob, rf on right knob, rh cross to left knob, lf onto ramp, stay low and slide over to lh crimp/pinch, reset feet and stand tall to lh crimp, stem lf to clip. It’s on >:) · Lead / Fell/Hung. Shut down at mantle. Oof. Opening stem feels p good tho. · Lead / Redpoint. Second session, third go total. First go of the day. First session was like 8 months prior. · TR. Fell a few times. Super hot day. Come back when it’s cold. Really sweet climb - like a bigger, badder Wham! · Lead / Fell/Hung. W Jamie. Fun start (juggy R & arete L, walk feet up highest r, stem to fall into L sp). Hard past slopey ramp - crank on R bad seam to ok knob move right to get two knobs off R toe hook (R around corner, L further knob, R better closer). “Levitation” - up & right up knobs to overhead gastundercling in roof to juggy sp? · TR. Fun and hard. At permadraw, right hand on positive side pull around corner. Cross lf over rf, lh crimp rail. Foot and hand moves somewhere, end up with lf on knob, rf on knob, rh to right knob, rf up on blob, lf to far left fat knob, · Found the 12 extension to be much easier than bottom crux honestly easiest part of the route. Just go for those middle anchors. · Lead / Fell/Hung. My partner led to the third bolt, lowered off, then I led the rest. I ended up stick clipping the 4th bolt to try the heel rock move. This route is hard, but I'd feel comfortable leading it with the second bolt stick clipped. · TR. Pretty sure this is 12c/d. Damn difficult, and I love slab and techy/crimpy/balancy climbing. Super dirty the whole way up, it could use a good scrub!"

Middle bit is scarier than expected. Okayish pro with flaring crack that isn’t super jam-able with almost bad feet on the steepish ramp. · Follow. traverse and chimney were fun. the middle section had some insecure hands and slopey feet. · Lead / Onsight. Kinda dirty but not too bad. Didn’t really super enjoy it, but the chimney was actually kind of fun. · Lead / Fell/Hung. took a big whipper out of nowhere on this one! feet were challenging in the middle ramp section. tons of gear! · Lead. With Fede. I psych myself up about the 0.4 section and then always hate it. · 2 pitches. Follow. second climb of the day with Tom, Sunday 9 2023. second pitch was absolutely amazing. 10/10 climbing. · Lead / Onsight. Easy ramp to silly chimney- can move rope to zoom chains · Follow. Didn’t get it on the first go, middle section on the slab was weird. · Lead / Flash. Brian bailed off this so I lead it. the moves are 5.8 but it's a solid lead. for the crux section you have good left hand/foot jams and have to make one or two right foot smears to move up. it protects and the rock quality is mostly ok aside from one of the easy flakes before the chimney, though you have to be thoughtful about placements so you don't block the key jams. the chimney is a tight squeeze. · Lead / Flash. as part of Leave My Flake Alone, w/ Darren. A little spicey getting off the ledge into the flake. · Lead / Flash. Fun! But not as chill as I expected for 5.8, since it’s index I guess haha. Couple tricky moves in the finger crack, but the chimney is fun and there’s some good feet · Lead / Flash. Fun! Finger crack was a bit intimidating, but takes as much gear as you can place and ends at a good resting stance. Chimney isn’t too bad, is short and has perfect hand crack in back and good edges for feet/hands. #3 was nice to have to protect entry into chimney but not necessary. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Much more intense directly after the bolt than I was expecting, need advice on gear placements to feel confident pulling up and into the crack system with marginal feet options. Still psyched I fought to the end and only really needed 2 rests in the same position to sort out gear · Follow. felt pretty ok. a couple hard hand moves. pretty gassed by this point, left hand did a weird spasm thing. can climb the top offwidth different ways. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Made myself take a few falls on gear. First falls on gear for me in a few years, I believe. · TR. Jeff lead Trad route and I did top rope. Do again on trad lead. V fun. · Follow. nice route with a little bit of everything. Felt a little easier than the other 5.8 routes at Index. Takes good gear all the way and ends with a narrow chimney."

It was given .12a in the original Clint Cumins guide, which I think it definitely earns in relation to other lowertownwall classics.

From the ledge, clip a bolt and climb up and right into a fun and juggy flake (.10) which takes great finger-sized gear. After the flake ends, a few bolts lead past a very tenuous crux crimping on perfect stone, with a few hero jugs over the roof to the chains.This pitch used to have a huge railroad spike bashed into a pocket up high (a drilled angle piton on steroids) and girth hitched for pro- this has been removed and replaced with a normal bolt. I wonder if the FA team ran out of bolts (or just wanted to save $) and simply walked over to the tracks and robbed the railroad for the final fixed piece.There is an extension which feature an immediate crux (chipped right hand pocket) rated .12b or .12c in the various books, and which then passes a couple more bolts and a remaining railroad spike \"piton\" before anchors up and right.

Actually the rest of the climb continued to be challenging with many balancey and burly mantels. Would certainly be challenging on lead. · Lead / Onsight. Cruxy first bit leads into enjoyable climbing. Did the tips crack exit, adds some more difficulties. Crazy gaston on the crux. Lila did an insane cross/splits/match thing. Added a half star for the length from SSUB · Lead / Onsight. This thing was fun I thought, pretty bouldery and a lil scary going far right (same or worse for the follower) def harder than cunning stunt for me but cool to figure it out · Lead / Redpoint. Hardest outdoor lead thus far. Mentally hard on the traverse after that the big moves went better · Lead / Fell/Hung. Not my ideal warmup, pulled a draw to get though the first hard mantle · Lead / Fell/Hung. Went how I used to up and right then back left from first chains and came off gettin spooked going left. Beta going straight up is better - high left foot, bump RH to arete and reach with LH up to flake. W/ Kaz and Emma · Follow. Bailed on the lead above 1st bolt. Followed Andrew. Clean traverse to the 2nd bolt on follow, but struggled considerably up the rest, exhausted · Lead / Fell/Hung. One hung right at the crux.. stay right then move left. · Follow. Sent with direct off the chains for p2 and also direct up finger crack near end · Lead / Fell/Hung. Did everything but the opening move, need to get right foot up somehow. · Lead / Fell/Hung. pulled on draws for first crux. could not figure out. go more right by using the left arete drop knee to high right crimp. move left feet far left. linked with tunnel vision · Lead / Fell/Hung. Very cool climb, the bolt spacing may seem scary if this is near your limit, but the hard moves are all well protected. A high foot during the second crux makes it feel much better. · Lead / Fell/Hung. First cruxy bit wasn't too bad. The second one after the second bolt was pretty desperate, at least in the summer heat. · Lead / Onsight. Went straight up through crux rather than going right and traversing back left. Felt harder than 10d that way, but fun. · Pretty sure Ive climbed this before. Body dependent grade. I’m 5.10 and cut feet to a dyno above 2nd bolt. It’s all there regardless. Never trust 10d at the dex. · Follow. fell quite a bit. big moves to big holds and damn the big moves are big, my height you kinda have to launch for them · TR. Went right then traversed left at the crux. Pulled on draw for 2nd crux · TR. Oof. Had to aid past a couple cruxy bits. My first real multipitch tho · Lead / Fell/Hung. Sweet climb. Difficult moves getting from bolt 1 to bolt 2 · Lead / Fell/Hung. Finally figured out the two cruxes today. La cabrona se vá en la próxima visita! · Lead / Onsight. pretty fun! made it a bit hard on myself a few times with choosing harder beta. Great crux! · TR.

        "route_tick_comments": "· Lead / Redpoint. Telling kids I onsighted this 25 years ago when I'm geezed out · Lead / Fell/Hung. Bolt to bolt. Very fun but tricky upper section slabby type moves on knobs. At left traverse, smear feet, match on left sidepull then wide balancy step left to knob. Huge jug out left after. At blank hands section, get left foot high, rock over onto it and press up smearing right foot for more friction. Press up on left foot allll the way to small right hand knob, then step through with right foot. At top, lean out right and get left foot up high, use little left hand crimp right below lip, then pounce to good part of top hold out right. · Lead / Redpoint. Happy!! Really tore the skin up. Next time wait till it’s true cold temps - possible climb for Ben and Natalya? · 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Tried it on Tr first, got it mostly clean except for a move getting past the bolt after the karate kick move. Tried again on lead and sent! Really cool bouldery slab cruxes separated by good rests · Lead / Fell/Hung. Took a fall on the 4th bolt and noticed the hive up high. Bailed and whipped my way back down. · Lead / Redpoint. Second go with Jordan he solved beta. Grab side pull and pinch knob to step down low · TR. Cruised first 3 bolts. Cruxed out on the traverse and barn doored. Upper section goes. · Lead / Fell/Hung. First crux- go farish right and use the knob that’s almost on the other route Second WHAM crux- after matching, move right hand down to knob before the big kick move · Lead. Almost onsight. Fell once lunging left for ticked knob with minimal feet. Hard! · Lead / Redpoint. Yay!! I finally sent this thing. I always have a really hard time redpointing. I get on a climb and feel so flummoxed, like I’ve never been on it before. Even though I’ve climbed the thing half a dozen times before. Same same this time. But I let my body take control on all the crux moves, not my brain. The moves that felt so insecure before were like second nature. After feeling beat down on this thing, I’m so glad to have sent. WHAM! · Lead / Fell/Hung. First go of the day on the project, fell at the crux, cruised the rest · Lead / Fell/Hung. First go of the day, cruised it past the crux to the next clip. Fell on a part I’d onsighted before, Got through the rest totally fine · Lead / Fell/Hung. Second go of the day. Kept fucking up on the first move. Once I finally got it I fell at the crux and came down · Lead / Fell/Hung. Tried it in the morning. Fingers hurt a lot. Came down at the crux · Lead / Fell/Hung. Tried this climb once today. Hung the last three draws. Struggled at the crux. Felt super good on everything at the top · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard! I think I have ok beta, gonna downsize the tc pros and try again · Lead / Redpoint. Let’s go! Second 11c of index. Feels way easier than so many other 11s. The grading here is weird (with Melissa Kevin and Stefano— an MP find) · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard to clip crux bolt and I found it to be very shoulder intensive move through that bolt and hard crux for me little reachy to the finish · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Doggy OS burn into 1fall lead burn. Maybe next time it goes · Lead. Second go! Tricked by the beta at the hard clip on the first · TR. Fell on 3rd crux doing the traverse thing over. 2nd crux had to gaston and get right foot high on knob · TR. UGH SO FUN!!!!! beta notes: nubbin section go a little right, right foot on horizontal edge (kinda bad) left foot super high, press into flat thing you wish was a undercling and statically reach to good nubbin. karate kick can be done slightly more statically by inching your feet/smearing. top bit get right hand on okay hold, left hand palm far left good nubbin reach statically to top · 3 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Second go one-hung it, third go fell up it, tired I guess? · 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Not the smartest thing to start with but it's what was open. Finally got it, if barely! w/ Karissa · Lead / Redpoint. Finally stuck karate kick second go of the day. So fun such good route · Lead / Redpoint. psyyyyyched. incredible climb. clip after kick? use high traverse at first crux. kick went with matched hands, try swing leg next time. high crux went easily with slopers · Lead / Fell/Hung. 2 hung. it was hot and cruxes were tough. Want to redpoint · TR. Still felt very hard, was also a like 80 some degrees and super humid today. Unlocked the initial layback, really high right foot next to the first bolt. Got close to the traverse, but couldn't figure it out still. Did the side pull pistol squat move, and couldn't do the final move to the chain. Gotta palm out left shuffle feet and work the hands then go for the jug. Super fun. W/ Dale and Mike · Lead / Redpoint. Wow so cool! At first the route is like “oooppffhh” and then it’s like “Wham!” And then you’re doing some moves to the chains and “yippee!” Then I was done and talked all about it for hours with my friend, Zach. Such a good route. I love the variety of techniques that need displaying. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard! Want to come back for the redpoint. Multiple cruxes of many different styles · Lead / Fell/Hung. hang draws for kick clip. bolt 2 look for tiny footchip out right. at kick match hold, r foot dish, l foot high crystal. l hand to next tiny knob, kick out to high knobs, press. at next slab right foot in horizontal, l foot up to knob, l hand up to sloper dish, bring r foot up. · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 slip and fall, not on one of the hard parts! oh well haha · Lead / Redpoint. Third go to send after a heart breaking o/s attempt. Sent after shanty one p started the boiler · Lead / Fell/Hung. Cliff put up the route to the traverse. Whipped my way up to the chains. Challenging and engaging throughout. Tried a lot of different things for the karate kick before trying the karate kick. Can’t believe that stuck. Pulled the draw on the first layback crux down low. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Almost got it onsite just took a couple times to figure out beta · Lead / Redpoint. Not great condies but at least wasn’t in the sun. Hung the draws myself on lead. The least dialed it has ever felt, accidentally skipped second bolt, somehow still sent. Sick! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung draws. Felts strong, and sent to the crux traversing back left. · Lead / Fell/Hung. couldn't figure slab crux after kick or clip at kick, rest went OK. · TR. Pulled all the moves but the high step(?) up top. Hung many many times · Lead / Fell/Hung. slipped off the bottom due to wet feet from snow. got upper crux beta: bring right foot up to very small lip directly under right hand knob (not the larger lip farther right), stand up, moveleft foot up to lip on the arete, match hands on knob, move left hand up as you stand up. for lower crux, keep left hand low so roght can get a good lip and keep core tension. · Lead / Redpoint. Sent after ~10x on route. Soft / sticky shoes and cool temps preferred · TR. struggled at pinch, moving right after jug, struggled with crimp rail. slabby feet. pulled up on rope · 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. In the final photons of dusk my headlamp gave out as I committed to the crux. Shoutout Thaddaeus and other homies for the backflag extendo crux clip beta! Hardest sport climb yet. · 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Beta burn and silly one-hang. So close! So sick! · TR. Leon put up wham. Tried, moves are damn hard. Got the layback start and traverse right and the bolts up to side pull. After side pull was desperate and pulled through · Follow. made it though the lieback start clean, couldn't make the final moves out of the traverse · Lead / Fell/Hung. Couldn’t do like two moves of the crux but made it up the rest. Cool nubs to climb on · Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to swing through the crux, as my feet weren’t sticking :( · Lead / Fell/Hung. Kick for higher [big] knob. Go up then left rather than low percentage throw out left. Condies matter! · Lead / Fell/Hung. progress with french Jonathan's beta! at left traverse, left good sidepull engaging thumb on bump, right hand on knob, get body low and reach foot out left and low, then match left sidepull · Lead / Fell/Hung. Pulled on crux draw to clip it (little hesitant climbing by headlamp), but clean otherwise. Fun! Will get it clean next time for sure. · Lead / Fell/Hung. several hang plus a couple aid moves. cool but so sandbagged at least in summer humidity. · Lead / Fell/Hung. every sequence feels improbably impossible, but goes, except the two that are actually impossible. · 2 pitches. Lead. one hung at first crux hanging draws. then clean tr lap · Lead / Redpoint. Got a surprise send after years of trying, the friction was superb · Lead / Onsight. High friction day. Amnesia onsight only climbed it in once like 2 years ago · 2 pitches. TR. first lap no falls, second lap fell at the step over gaston move · TR. still working out the traverse. feels like both hands on left facing edge, then kick out foot to far left foothold. · TR. fell once at the end of the traverse. fell few times at upper knob crux. remember hidden feet. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Knobs look so good, but it’s on!!! Wild route featuring insecure laybacking, an improbable karate kick, and very delicate standing up on knobs (fell here). Oh, and a big ol sloper to finish it off · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 fall down low moving right into jug. Top was tenuous but held it together cleanly · Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 fall just before the crux; pulled on a couple draws after that. Feel pretty good about the lead. · TR. TRedpoint. Key at crux was to go low after the sidepull at crux bolt: stretch to lower LF (not the gigantic knob, but a smaller one directly below it), and then LH into the huge flake jug. · Follow. The crux is super reachy...I'll have to wait for better conditions to try getting both hands on the side pull so I can maybe reach a toe out to the key foot nub."

Almost had the onsight. Fell once pulling at the top of the seam. I did indeed feel more alive on this than slow children. Scary committing chicken heads. Had to dyno the start · Lead / Onsight. Missed a hold at the start, heady mantle off the ground · TR. Nailed upper crux, just flailed around at the start had to cheat today · TR. Bottom Crux: jump for sloper. Walk feet up, left foot on nub, left hand side pull, right foot on white spot. Pull hard with left hand and dig in with right toe, reach up for pocket, sink it high. Feet on sloper and rock over · Lead / Fell/Hung. Pulled through the mantle but did the rest. Bring tiny nuts! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Very hot day, sweaty hands. Great climbing, but run out of morale at the last move of the face. Protection is skinny but there, but you gotta trust your moves. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Went right near the top. Was too scared to climb above gear there. · Lead. Started pouring right before getting to the finger lock lol, bailed to the zoom anchors · Lead / Onsight. Dyno into the first sloper, hike feet, right hand to side pokey crimp, tilt body, left hand to second crimp, mantle. The middle is tricky. (Tech redpoint but didn’t remember climbing prev) · TR. Many hangs Start beta: good L side pull, step through R foot on small knob, flag L; stand R and mantle on R sloper · Lead / Redpoint. Have to jump to ball, then move left hand to left side pull, right foot step through to knob on left, flag left foot, then right hand slowly up to hole/sidepull up and right. Pretty chill if I do it right. The rest is just good footwork and balance totally in my wheelhouse. 1 small brass nut and another medium nut later regular finger ant tip cams. No 00 needed. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on the mantel and restarted. Then had trouble closer to the top · Lead / Fell/Hung. Caleb led it up to the run out. I TRed up to that point. Took a reminder fall above the nut. Then worked my way through the crux. Had to take a breath to finish the route. Headier than when I TRed it. · Lead / Fell/Hung. took hella whips (3 of which were on the 000) and got a lil spooked and got it dialed. first time tying in with the homie Nina! Connor also kicked it with us and gave a TR lap as well! · TR. Aside from the boulder start this was somewhat cruiser. I went left at the mini bulge roof. Probably ready for a lead go · Lead / Redpoint. Fell a couple times at the start. Lowered down and then sent it. · TR. This thing was so fun, but holy fuck it would be so heady on lead. Maybe one day. No falls though · Lead / Flash. Should have saved a .3 and a gold dmm offset nut for the pro before the final runout · TR. TRonsight! gear dialed too!! very stoked to come back and lead this bad larry. with spencer · Lead / Redpoint. So proud of myself for this one! Brought the wrong piece for the top and had to run it out (last placement was the #.4 in the seam/finger lock). · Lead / Redpoint. With Erik and Ryan. Hard crux at the bottom and exciting movement on amazing features above! · TR. Difficult mantle. Had to match it get the right crimp put the left back to continue · TR. A few falls on start, but then did it through. Mantle with side pull then go for small pocket crimp · Lead. First go: oh shit I’m gonna die Second go: chill. Amazing nut. Had to jump for the start · Lead / Fell/Hung. Chickened out on the run out section and took a shorter fall. Sent it after a quick rest. There is a jug and decent pro right after the run out. · TR. Clean TR, but my left foot slipped during the \"mental crux\". I'd stick clip the first two bolts if I tried to lead it. I have to jump off the right foot and grab the first left hand (go for far left on the bulge).

Struggled on the cruxes more the second time, but did better at the top. Still did it \"clean\" on TR after a false start. · TR. We set a top rope w/o leading.

Linked into Leave my face alone for one long fun pitch · TR. awesome route! I couldn't reach the start hold so had to jump for it. would have to have the gear dialed to lead it because it felt pretty committing at the top section. · TR. Did not find the knob climbing particularly easy, had a hard time trusting feet. Fun though otherwise · TR. fell off the mantle a few times but once I got it the rest of the route went, super cool rock, seems well protected, would recommend! · TR. First pitch of the day. Right hand into the Mono thing after establishing the good side pull that’s far left as you step onto the wall. After, throw a heal-to-toe smear and swing into a mantle · Lead / Onsight. Proud onsight. Heady climbing above but not bad. Not a gimme though, and above a small wire and small cams · Lead / Redpoint. Opening sequence beta: left foot on a knob, left hand up into left pocket, use the mono, right foot into some shitty dish directly below NOT out right, right hand up, get left foot up onto mantle and stand up. · TR. 2 laps, few hangs at the beginning the first time, otherwise clean. Right hand sloper knob, left hand side pull, left foot on nub, right foot back flag, right hand deadpoint to crimp, foot up and mantel · Lead / Flash. Very fun and a little scary with the small nuts. Jess went to the first thin crack and bailed so had some gear in there. Almost blew that last lil sequence. Maple good dog. · Lead / Fell/Hung. Couldn’t get the step up after mantel to 2nd bolt. Fell above brassie on face. · TR. Opening move is desperate, would love to put it together but the gear is *run out* · TR. Hard start, i guess i missed a mono or something. Excellent route otherwise! · TR. Birds nest with chirping babies in a crack in the middle of the route, avoid for a while · TR. Lower section was ok. Slipped an the insecure knob up high. Trusted it the second time around. Finally trying 10s in Index · 3 draws, then 0.75 (sling), 2, 2, small nut, bomber offset 0.3/0.4 cam or medium nut in finger crack below crux, 0.3 after crux"

To pull the final move, left hand pinky and ring finger lock and then to jug rail. had multiple takes and falls · Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell once pulling over the bulge. Fun crack! Some of the jams are a bit hard since it flairs at the top. · TR. Very hard wide fingers. Need to figure out how to properly jam up top. Route isn’t as long as it looks because bottom is easy. Would love to project if not for the heinous approach. · Lead / Fell/Hung. great pitch. fell at the crux but wasn't due to lack of effort! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Adventurous first 20 feet.

Need to rebelay just below the final move off a .3 and .4. Place plenty of directionals or you'll spin off into space as the route overhangs like 10 feet and traverses about 15 feet. I was able to link from ground to just below the roof. I didn't figure out how to do the last move. Gear seems solid, however I'm unsure how to protect the opening moves. · TR. So good! With good conditions, it wouldn't feel too bad. Slipped out of a handjam after the lieback and fell a few times at the top crux before figuring it out. Gotta get the right foot up to the knob on the right wall · TR. First round of the session didn't get a proper warm up. First section felt okay then just need to work out the beta and move faster on the lay-back section. And the top Crux is nuts. Real fun roof. Hand jam move. · TR. What an ass kicker. Fell at the sloper on second burn! Amazing pitch. Stem up (set feet right and push hard) to reach lh crimp on sloper ramp, rh to hidden crimp (order may be reversed I forget), work feet up, rh to sloper, lh to good further knob, feet, rh to Gaston sloper, pop to anchor jug. · 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Save .2 and .3 for top, 3 for roof. No 1s needed, but several .75s used · 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. With Rio. P1 only. 7 TR laps, 1st lead go. Didn't have the gear totally dialed but still sent. Must be a low gravity day. · TR. Made it to top crux, but had to hang and get sprayed down to figure it out. Felt good! But would be a hard lead · 1 pitch. TR. Hung a lot but did all the moves clean. Thuggy and so good! · TR. 3 TR burns followed Ben’s first lead burn with dying light on the last. · 1 pitch. TR. Top roped twice. Was able to figure out all the moves, it definitely goes. Lieback is only really necessary necessary for like two moves to move right foot up and stem higher. Below the small roof/no hands rest the beta is to stay mostly straight in the crack until possible to move left foot up. Then more stemming to jug, to get to the chains, stem from top of jug, stay low and hand traverse left on slopers until finding a good left hand and getting left foot up on ledge. · 1 pitch. TR. with Aaron. did all the moves except wet top out boulder problem. pretty cool route.. stemming, laybacks, fist and hand jams · 1 pitch. TR. W/ Ben hung a few times, but did all the moves to the wet last 15 ft. Super inspiring route!!!"

You could try to clip the bolt from your next stance, but it will still be very difficult to reach (The move is full wingspan and harder than 5.10- ... but do keep in mind that the climb is a one-move wonder) Anyways, it definitely works to haul on your nut to get that bolt clipped if you are under 6 feet tall... or you could just clip using the climb's crux hold!

Yet the area does not retain cold pockets of air on clear winter days. Sunlight strikes the walls in the morning, leaving the rock in the shade from the early afternoon.With the adjacent areas of The Black Sea and the Lower Cheeks, this area has a concentration of climbing that rivals in quality and surpasses in scenic beauty any of the more traveled classics of the Lower Wall.For instance, the 2nd pitch of the Up'er Zipper is as good as steep crack climbing gets in an astounding alpine position.

Exit the cave right (straight up is Levee) and you will see an intermediate anchor after a couple more bolts.P2 - There is a couple ways to go about the 2nd pitch. The arete above the P1 anchor is a closed project!Option 1: Mega Pitch - use long slings or skip bolts to link the first pitch into the second. Rest up and continue to the right and up through some of the best stone index has to offer.Option 2: Project P2 without P1 - My favorite option. Set up a fixed line at the anchor and jug up to P2 while the belayer enjoys the good life on the beach ledge. Probably the most fun way to tackle p2 and takes out any rope drag issues.Option 3: Pitch it out and belay at anchor - Probably the least fun option, but you could do this. You and the belayer would be tight.",

Yesterday, Sept 23rd I also free climbed to the quad summit after placing all gear on lead, just before a soaking rain descended on the valley. The grade may settle in the 13+ range for those 6' climbers, but on a personal note, I am convinced it was 14a for me, which would make this my most difficult gear lead, something I'd never imagine I could do at 47 with kids and profession.  But, the greatest joy of this project by far was the sense of mutual support I felt working it with Stamati ...cleaning, the beta mining sessions, figuring out the gear, believing in the gear, and of course the route itself which is perfection.Thanks to all the folks whom contributed to the process: Tavish, Nate, Adam, Trevor, Cindy, Monica, Brock, Mark, Hunter and likely other I may have forgot.

Mantle up to the ledge (original ending of P1 --can still see the old pin), negotiate past seasonal vegetation, and dance up a knob studded corner, palming and stemming to a final 10' of harder than it looks open book climbing.  5.11+Pitch 2 variation: Ascend past 1 bolt up the clean featured face to regain the corner. Mantle up onto the sweet 2x2' perch and check out the views, surrounded by steep granite. After clipping another bolt, match a huge sloper and pull over left into another small RFC with an engaging finish, leading up to the Sky Lounge Ledge. 5.11aPitch 2 original: stay in the LFC the entire way. Gear looks sketchy up high, hard to place, and it is dirty still despite me scrubbing on it for hours. 10+?Pitch 3: Ascend the aesthetic corner requiring classic index chicanery.  If you're tall it might feel 11d, if short more like 12+.

Struggled with getting my right leg up in a small box. Didn’t try the jump that many times · Send. very high quality. Diverse movements, but hated having to double dyno so much. · Attempt. tried the static beta. might have to go dyno though. super classic, come back for this one · Send. Repeat. Not sure I’ve ever repeated, always felt kinda hard / committing. Manifesting the theme of better vs. stronger…was not ready for Hag today. · Send. August 15, 2023 I fractured my radius by falling on the landing zone boulder. Finally got revenge and sent this great rig! · Attempt. getting close to the send, slapping the top, the trick is a slow left foot pistol squat to stick the left hand and hold the barn door. · Send. One of my proudest sends to date. Second of the grade for me · Send. Sent on third session. Bottom felt much easier after dialing in the moves. Top still felt impossible while staring down the lip (just like it always did while sticking the move in isolation). · Send. day 2. so fun! thumb on that side pull was super important. also placing the initial toe correctly. · Send. Somehow dry enough to climb in Jan. Top of the boulder was a swimming pool so the mantle was a lot harder. · Attempt. Got to the jumping position a few times, think going to left hand is best. This one is all in the legs, basically 3 pistol squats in a row. Skin was bad and tried taping tips of middle two fingers in LH and helped so much · Send. Blew the flash. Slipped on the jug after dynoing. Didnr have it deep enough. All star line · Send. Press beta babyyyy. I'll come back and do the full dyno version later · Attempt. Usually don't tick attempts but I need to come back for this classic. So close! Good enough to have stayed all day projecting · Send. Great problem! Probably 6 or 7 attempts to figure out the beta. Felt very hard at first, but felt casual once dialed (heel hook is def the beta at start). · Send. The moves necessary to send Leggo are balancy and committing. So, naturally, I thought it was great! · Lead / Fell/Hung. Can’t commit to the jump! Got the right pad placement beta down now for next tims · Send. Took me a session and a half just to figure out beta for the bottom that worked. Dyno didn't feel that hard. Maybe harder than V6 as a whole? Very good problem. · Send. Very good problem. Kinda scary for me. Used the Left hand to go for the huck · Attempt. got bottom dialed but couldn't commit to top throw dyno. Night session with Pat. · Feels like a solid V6, definitely easier to stick the dyno using the left sidepull. · Rather than throwing for the lip with the left hand, I felt it better to get the left hand over to the good side pull on the left and then hit the lip with the right hand. · Solo. Finally sent. Maybe two dozen attempts? Almost equally close for the last dozen before sticking the left hand. · Annnd sent using right variation/tall guy beta. Sick dyno to the lip! SO GOOD · No send but very close. Hit the lip multiple times. Need fresh skin to try again. Awesome line"

No knee pad and started matched at the pocket (LH in pocket and RH immediately adjacent on the sloping lip) · Send. Awesome problem. Went in a few goes. My crux was moving from the pocket to the lip, and then not dabbing as I brought my feet around. Great climb, a lot of techniques at play! · Had a minor dab, but I’m counting it for myself.

LF flag hard just below good foot edge to get LH to good top crimp - best furthest left. Crazy back toe LF to release RF heel and bring to toe at left end of starting rail. Try harder! Skwama felt better for heel than solution comp, but didn’t try comps again once fully warmed up. · Regained high point atop rail. Feel moving foot in to good spot. Conditions less than ideal, so pretty happy with this still. Hard on skin so make every go count! · Attempt. A move short of the top of the rail, but decent effort given I was hungry/dehydrated/fingers weren’t warmed up properly for this level of crimping · Send. 4 sessions, couldn’t latch the top sloper till I learned the direction of the well! Need to be more thoughtful of micro beta in the future! Felt amazing to finally hold on · Attempt. So fun! Have to come back for the send. Start beta that finally worked for me: Start with hands crossed on starting jug, LH on the good part, RH higher (there's a tiny dime edge to help). Bump LH to shallow crimp. RF high to the ramp at end of starting rail. Push hard and bump LH past next crimp to the third on the rail, then cross RH to good crimp. Bump heel to ledge, LH to final crimp. Jump!"

Continue more or less straight, bushwhacking until you get the vertical wall of dirt. Straight ahead there should be a pile of large boulders about 30’ tall, recognizable by one large Boulder at the top which has a huge hole beneath it (see photo). The trail goes up and LEFT from here and is quite steep and likely the only part of the trail that looks established. It might be tricky getting to this part but is MUCH preferable to going to the right of the floating block (trust me). Once on top of the boulder pile, head left for 3-5 minutes across the boulder field and you’ll hit the problems. The “Almost There” graffiti is mostly gone now and the problems are likely mossy and dirty. Jul 12, 2022",
