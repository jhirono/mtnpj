                "route_description": "Canary ascends from the right side of Logger's Ledge and reaches the top of Castle Rock in 3 pitches. A memorable line, Canary combines interesting climbing with terrific exposure.Approximately 100 feet to the left of Saber, a short section of face climbing leads to a right facing dihedral and a broken crack system that reaches the left side of Saber ledge. This is the start of Canary.P1. Begin by climbing approximately 15 feet of unprotected face to the base of a right facing dihedral. This section is not trivial, but the holds are positive and it is no harder than 5.7. Alternatively, it may be possible to begin in a small dihedral to the left and traverse right to gain the crack system at the top of the face. From the top of the face, follow the dihedral and subsequent crack systems up with good gear. Ascend until you are under the giant roof, then break right onto Saber ledge at the top of the crack system. This pitch is the technical crux of the climb, culminating in the moves up and onto Saber Ledge (5.8). Belay from gear or the giant eyebolts on the right of Saber Ledge.P2. From Saber ledge, contemplate what lies ahead. The second pitch begins with instant exposure, and the airy step off Saber ledge may be the pyschological crux of the climb. Begin by traversing obvious holds leading left and slightly up from Saber ledge. Though intimidating, the traverse is easier than it looks, and giant holds await you on the arete. It is possible to protect the traverse with a reasonable small alien on the face, otherwise it may be possible to place large gear (with long slings!) above Saber ledge before beginning. Upon reaching the arete, climb past two bolts and follow your nose and your gear.P3. From the alcove on the face, continue upwards on increasingly slabby terrain, following the intermittent cracks for protection. Like many routes on upper Castle, the exact line is not obvious; expect some runouts on easier terrain.. Belay at the top.To descend, follow the trail off the back of the summit to Logger's Ledge.",

Maybe smth like \"flash marriage\" etc, would make a better name to show how pitch 2 makes you feel? - It's fun for some people, and you keep telling yourself it's gonna be fine, yet your legs can't help shaking the closer you get.

Lead / Fell/Hung.    Follow. Alex lead all routes, and I followed. Amazing views. We ended up doing a very small third pitch.    Lead / Onsight. Got stuck in the coal mine for a little bit.

Old Grey Mare start was so much better, not run out.  I almost led 1st pitch clean, had to take a few times to get the last move. Getting the right foot established in the high V is key *before* trying to reach the finish jugs.  2nd pitch start has hidden funky #2 placement that helps a lot.  From there, continued 2nd pitch all the way to the summit.   1 pitch.  Follow.  \u2022 No names/notes    Follow. Followed clean, no falls. First pitch is vertical under roof 5.8+ climbing good pro. Second pitch is exposed first couple moves, protect with .3 in face hold, make two committing moves on good holds plug #2 in above jug, continue up to first bolt. Sustained 5.8+ climbing a lot of face moves. Third pitch is mostly chill, lots of runout but chunky climbing, look for fixed piton, made rope anchor off rock up top for epic topout.

TR. kind of did the chimney variation on tr almost the whole way.  w Chad, Andrew, Sudah    Follow. This was fun which I probably could have lead   2 pitches.  Lead / Fell/Hung. Awesome route. Burly! Should try for the send.     TR. lots of left shoulder scraping, lots of takes    Lead / Onsight. Much less intimidating than it looks from the ground. Ton of gear and features to stop this from being a pure crack. Would climb again.    TR.     Lead / Onsight. Fun route \nBumped a # 4 (2 #4s would be nice)on the lower then a # 6 on the upper upper took some finger size pieces to protect    TR.    Lead.    Follow.    Lead / Redpoint. Finally!! I am now worthy!     TR. Stellar!!! Probably something you want to headpoint\u2026or maybe someone should ad a bolt or too    TR. hmm, it turns out that the chimney and above is quite easy if ya just use chimney techniques the whole way...last time I turned around after the wide part, which ratchets up the difficulty. I was facing the road while chimneying, which seemed wrong before, but is definitely the way to go. The lower section is still as greasy as ever...    TR. Burly! Even on top rope. I obviously need more practice with this style of climbing.    Lead / Flash. Get your head together. Runout chimney    Lead / Redpoint.    Lead.    TR.    Lead / Fell/Hung.   2 pitches.  Lead / Fell/Hung. Physical but fun. No laybacking needed - jams and feet are there. #5 useless in the chimney, backed off the lead..Max was able to run it out and find some secret small gear, but still very bold  \u2022 No names/notes    Lead / Flash.    Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to back clean ALOT    TR. Clean on TR, hard first 15' and stays hard the whole way. Amazing climb!    Lead / Fell/Hung.    Lead / Fell/Hung. I entered the chimney with my back facing the road, which made it seemingly impossible to turn around at the constriction. Sooo, I pulled on my #6 to turn around. Otherwise, my send was clean. Next time I should save a #3 for use up high.     Lead / Onsight.  \u2022 No names/notes    TR.    Lead / Redpoint.    TR. Awesome climbing!!    Lead / Redpoint.    Lead / Onsight.  \u2022 No names/notes    Follow.    Lead / Onsight. didn't have a 4,5, or 6....  \u2022 No names/notes    TR. Climbed clean. Set rope from Midway.  \u2022 No names/notes    Lead / Fell/Hung.    Follow.  \u2022 No names/notes  \u2022 No names/notes    TR. Slipped and fell about 20 ft up.    TR.    Lead / Flash. So this pitch might be one of the best in the state; great jams, stacks and stems the whole way. Not a single necessary lieback.    Lead / Onsight. super fun. fun layback to chimney stemming \n . exactly what you want for a chimney route    Lead / Fell/Hung.    Lead / Onsight. w dan, maggie, vera    Follow.     Lead / Onsight. Really odd gear, but a fantastic route! The crux felt down low with the two #4s, but the rest was more secure, just cryptic.    Lead / Onsight. tricky gear at top.  left shoulder in at upper chimney    TR. Not a lot of crack climbing for me. Got really big quickly. Top seemed spooky to lead but really fun climbing!"

This protects very well and getting into and over the bulge at the bottom of the crack is the crux.

Crux comes to the final part, gaining the tower from a ledge, as the main wall is too clean, and I right knee jammed in the large crack, left foot stem on the tower, would be nice to protect with #4; to start pitch 2, stand as close to the main wall as possible, lean onto it with hands, move right foot over, place a pro, then push onto the main wall with left foot, climb up the corner onto a ledge to the left, traverse right aim for the ring, looking for good foot holds, hands on crack where pros can be placed, once reach the gully, climb up through it, reaching the belay station, build gear anchor; didn't remember the details of pitch 3, mostly traverse up and right meeting a sweet deep crack, climb along the crack, then take the least steep line on the right edge (no pro here but quite easy slab), wrap around the horn as anchor.

Led all three pitches. \n1st pitch - used a #4 in the wider crack above (crux move). Laying back on the main wall and using the jello tower for smearing (chimney move) and using the heel toe technique for the crack. \n2nd pitch - Start was airy - lying on the main wall and right leg on it used a yellow totam to protect (I asked the follower from the party before us to place it for me to avoid a factor 2 fall incase I wasn\u2019t able to make the move). I went up and traversed right a bit using the finger crack and went up diagonally again. In hindsight I should have traversed  right low and gone to the wide gully and up. That would have been easier. Belayed from gear for this pitch. \nPitch 3 - easier pitch and a bit run out at the end. Just used a purple totam on the crack and went up. \nWalk off - Easy walk off leading to a trail.    Follow.  \u2022 No names/notes   1 pitch.  Lead / Flash. P2. Followed by Conrad C.

No 4 this time, so the protection through the first pitch was just small cams. Kind of committing there until you reach the piton. Awkward but less awkward than last time. P1 belay is awkward. The step across wasn't bad and you can place a piece (.75 I think) before doing it. And also a yellow Metolius up higher in a nice little crack. Didn't even clip the piton, it looks like the head is kind of bent and hard to clip anyways. Second pitch was great. Went straight up for a ways and found the ring pin. Traverse was fun. A little heady but solid. Third pitch is fine, pretty easy, not super long. Beautiful horn up top to sling to belay from. Walk off wasn't too bad or too long. Overall a fun route. It's in the sun so would be nice on a cooler day.

Super fun route, stiff for 5.6 (at least the chimney). Appreciated having the 4\u201d topping out the chimney & for the belay (one can clean it after topping out Jello Tower). Beneficial to climb through to the alcove stance using 3\u201d/4\u201d & tips for anchor. \n\nBump up & right after 20\u2019 climbing. Traverse was awesome, funky pro led to great corner/ ledge belay w small nut, \u201c1, & purple totem. \n\nFunky start & initial 20\u2019 to the awesome hand crack to wicked cool puzzle-hueco face. Pro was thin, a wrong sequence could prove dangerous but otherwise it is simple & fun! \n\nPlentiful boulder/ horn belay options on the summit. \n\n3.5/4*  \u2022 No names/notes    Lead.

Former PNW crusher Kyle O'Meara envisioned a direct start up beautiful white rock which would allow the route to be climbed in one pitch. Unfortunatly, Kyle ran out of bolts, and was only able to sink in the first three. Nonetheless it didnt keep Kyle from freeing the line with a stick clip to start and traditional pro (a few cams and a sea of manky fixed pins) through the upper crux bulge. This half-finished pseudo-\"traditional\" version saw possibly just one additional free ascent over the next few years. In the spring of 2014, Dave Morales, added the missing couple of bolts to the direct start, replaced the manky fixed pins through the upper crux with bolts, and added a lower 2-bolt anchor.The route begins with beautiful climbing using perfect edges and side-pulls on aesthetic white stone. From a midway rest ledge a perplexing bouldery crux leads to a more moderate finish up a shallow corner system.",

Look for a left angling ramp just to the right of a large, low roof.  This is the start of Saber.P1.  Climb the left angling ramp to the base of a left facing dihedral.  The rock in the dihedral has been polished to a slippery, disconcerting, mirror-like sheen.  When you hit a diaganol crack heading up to the left follow it to Saber ledge.  Belay from bolts. (~90 feet)P2.  A few easy moves (~5.5) on the left side of a wide chimney take you up onto emminently forgettable and blocky terrain.  The climbing gets easier as you ascend, and I found myself on 4th or 3rd class terrain long before reaching the top of Castle rock (~190 feet).I've stuck with the historical rating for this climb, which may be a bit of a sandbag-- a more realistic rating for the first pitch may be 5.6.  Combined with the polished rock, this route is probably not the best choice for a fledgling trad leader.  One star for history and for being an accesible moderate as well as a good place to booty gear, but I can't imagine wanting to do this twice.",

One can lead belay up followers and link this route up with p2 and p3 of Midway with minimal rope drag by building a rope anchor around the pinnacle at the top of the route (before the traverse to the shared anchors at the top of jello tower).\n\nWe belayed the last climber to the jello tower /Midway chains once we were all up and just prussik belayed ourselves over on that strand once he had built an anchor there for added safety, but the walk over isn\u2019t too bad.
