It should be tagged as `tiny-finger-size` and `finger-size`.\n\nConsider the following cam sizes from different manufacturers:\nBlack Diamond Camalot (BD):\n[0] green 0.38 in\n[.1] red 0.44 in\n[.2] yellow 0.52 in\n[.3] blue 0.73 in\n[.4] gray 0.83 in\n[.5] purple 1.04 in\n[.75] green 1.28 in\n[#1] red 1.62 in\n[#2] yellow 2.01 in\n[#3] blue 2.73 in\n[#4] gray 3.55 in\n[#5] purple 4.6 in\n[#6] green 6.09 in\n[#7] red 7.94 in\n[#8] yellow 10.1 in\n\nMetolius TCU:\n*00 Gray 0.4 in\n*0 Purple 0.5 in\n*1 Blue 0.6 in\n2 Yellow 0.75 in\n3 Orange 0.9 in\n4 Red 1.2 in\n\nNuts or Stoppers are another protection gear for fingers.\n\nAlien Cam\nBlack Size Range: .44 in\nBlue Size Range: .53 in\nGreen Size Range: .7 in\nYellow Size Range: .8 in\nGrey Size Range: .94 in\nRed Size Range: 1.0 in\n\nFriends\nxxx\n\nTricam\nxxx\n\nExample input and output:\nInput: \"Standard rack up to 2 inches, doubles in finger sized gear.\"\nOutput: [\"finger-size\"]\nInput: \"LOTS of small cams!!! Nuts don't work in this crack very well. I think I may have used 4 yellow aliens.\"\nOutput: [\"finger-size\"]\nInput: \"Protection to 0.5 camalot, with extras in the blue and yellow tcu size. There is a good 2 bolt anchor at the top.\"\nOutput: [\"tiny-finger-size\", \"finger-size\"]\nInput: \"Standard rack with gear to 4-5 inches.\"\nOutput: [\"wide\"]\nInput: \"#.75 Friend and below, medium nuts, 2 bolts. You could fit in something big in the flaring off-width on the right, but the left crack is sufficient. Anchor is 1 chain and 1 shut.\"\nOutput: [\"finger-size\", \"nuts\"]\nInput: \"Gear to 3\", with the bulk of it in small sizes, especially small nuts.  There are many bolts at the top, and this route (along with every other route here) is easily top-roped.\"\nOutput: [\"finger-size\", \"nuts\"]\nInput: \"Single rack with gear to 3\" and doubles in the small finger to finger range. Optional larger pieces can be placed in the begining of the first pitch. Some bolts as well.\"\nOutput: [\"finger-size\", \"tiny-finger-size\"]\nInput: \"Gear to 3\", with the bulk of it in small sizes, especially small nuts.
