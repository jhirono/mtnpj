        "description": "The Art exhibit is a forested east facing crag on the south side of Debecks hill, just behind the sky ridge development. The cliff gets filtered morning sun and stays cool all day on hot summer days. The cliff is vertical to gently overhanging and is mostly smooth granite with sharp positive edges. Routes are roughly 18-20m tall. A single 60m rope will work for all routes. With any new wall, there will always be a bit of exfoliation and wearing a helmet is always recommended!\u00a0Casey and I developed only a small portion of the entire cliff band. There is still a significant amount of rock left, undeveloped. An additional 20-30 routes could easily be added if other developers decide to add some lines.",
        "getting_there": "Park at the North end of Tantalus drive. Approx 10-15mins uphill. Hike up through the looking glass trail until a T intersection. Go right up Plural of Nemesis until another T intersection. Go left and over a little wooden bridge. You will see the cliff on the right side of the trail just about the bridge. Follow the light climbers trail along the base of the cliff until you reach the Art Exhibit. The red x on the map is the location of the crag.",

        "description": "Debeck's Hill is a \u00a0sport climbing crag sitting conveniently a 15-20 min walk up a a forest service road in Alice Lake Park. While a couple of routes had been done in the late 1990's, it was cleaned and further developed in 2019 with additional development ongoing. There are currently about 20 climbs with more in work. There is a first tier of climbs about 20m tall and a second tier of slightly longer climbs which can be accessed by climbing the lower climbs or using a fixed line up a mossy ramp. The lower tier is in the trees and stays mostly shaded but the upper tier gets morning and midday sun. The crag sits directly next to the trail / road giving it a chill cragging vibe. The climbing is much more fun and interesting than it first appears with many great routes.I have only climbed some of the climbs on the first tier but there is also a second tier with a few routes and more in development. All the climbs seemed to have fixed anchors / chains and some had biners set up for easy cleaning. Feel free to add more routes to MP as you climb them!As of July 2023, crag is a bit mossy in spots (adds to the less than inspiring appearance), but most of the climbs are sufficiently cleaned to climb. Could use some additional scrubbing though!News article about crag:  seatoskyclimbing.ca/latest-\u2026 link to topo on \"Sea to Sky Climbing\":  static1.squarespace.com/sta\u2026",
        "getting_there": "Park in the southern most lot at Alice Lake Provincial park. Walk south to the turn around loop and at the end of the pavement turn right onto a dirt road blocked by a yellow gate (sign for Debeck's hill). Keep right at the first junction and walk 15-20 minutes uphill. The crag will be on your left directly off the side of the dirt road.(Walking another 15 minutes up the road gets you to the top of Debeck's hill and a great lunch spot with a view!)",

It has one of the fastest and flattest approaches, a comparable walking distance from smoke bluffs parking to free and easy crag (approx 10 mins). The cliff has filtered sun and stays cool on hot days. There is also a year round creek nearby for water. A 60m rope will work for all routes. Most routes are mixed. Most routes have only seen 1 or 2 ascents and with any new wall there will always be some rock exfoliation, so wearing a helmet is always recommended.PDF topo link belowhttps://drive.google.com/file/d/1-A6Fp3dqAkOjO2fldePilMgjXClKtFhR/view?usp=drivesdk",

Hike south down the very popular wonderland trail back to Squamish (use trail forks if you dont know where the trail is). This patch of forest is exceptionally beautiful and the walk alone is worth it through those woods. When you hit a creek, stay on the main trail (southbound) until the trail crosses over the creek. Roughly 30 meters after the bridge, Follow the light climbers trail on the left, that leads past two boulders. You\u2019ll see the looming cliff up and on your left. 10 mins of flat easy walking from car.",
