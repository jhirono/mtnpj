The largest piece you could place would be a #1 camalot at the overlap, but there are many alternatives.  There is one very old bolt near the top and then a good two bolt anchor with chains.   NOTE: with a 70m rope you can get down, but you have to be careful to take advantage of the base sloping up to the left and rope stretch.  With anything shorter, you'll need to use two ropes to get down.  Alternatively, the leader can top belay (on a very nice ledge) and the second can bring up the second rope.   If you're SUPER careful, you can rap with a single 60m rope if you land to the left, where the ground slopes upward.  Use knots!", "expected_output": ["finger-size", "nuts", "gear-anchor"]}
