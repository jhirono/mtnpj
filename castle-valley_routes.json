        "area_description": "Castleton Tower is probably the most famous desert tower in the world, and was the first major tower climbed in the Moab area.  The Kor-Ingalls route is one of the 50 Classic Climbs of North America, and Castleton also has one other 5.9 route of the same caliber.  Harder classic routes both aid and free exist on its fantastic Wingate sandstone with its unique calcite crust.   Castleton is most climber's first desert tower, and it is common for lines to form on the Kor-Ingalls during the spring and fall.  All the free routes are trad, and you should be solid at the grade - this is not a good place to break into 5.9.",
        "area_getting_there": "You will find the campground on Castle Valley road about 1/4 to a 1/2 mile after the cattle guard in the road on the left. From the campground/parking lot hike up the wash following the cairns until you get to a dirt road. Cross this road at a cairn and a signpost with an arrow pointing along the trail.   The approach takes an hour if you are in shape, but it is strenuous.",

We dragged a bunch of chain up and the big 1/2 inch steel snippers. We removed the old chain and equalized the stuff I dragged up there last spring. ON that previous job the drill broke down so I wasn't able to add the stainless bolts. All anchors now have at least 1 stainless halfie with the chain.  The old chain was probably good for a few more years (though it was rusted together), but the way it was wset up, to one single cold shut worth only 900 pounds when brand new, was unnaceptable. Those things are made of soft metal and are never tested... the 900 pounds is an average. IN any event, it is now set up with big rings and rated to way over what we can generate. It should last a while. You will notice there is about 5 feet of chain linking the long halfie to the orginail bolts. This is because I had to go 5 feet back from the rim to find a non-hollow spot in the cap rock. Its not pretty, but it makes it easy to get over the lip and is a much more stout rap anchor. We also brought the top anchor on the Kor Ingals up to speed with chain. We ran out of time and were not able to do the lower rap... that will have to wait. Sep 28, 2007",

There has been an increase in campers NOT using the pit toilet, creating new campsites on fragile desert plants/soils, and illegal parking along the road.

Continue up for about 20' to a handcrack on the left which is followed to a 10' 5.9 offwidth and the ledge system at the end of Kor Ingals P1.  Belay in an alcove on the right.   P2. 10+, 100'.  Classic.  Up broken rock for 15' and enter an overhanging flair.  The crux flair has good pro, good rock and technical, strenuous moves.  (10+ seemed like a sandbag grade to us; this section felt at least as hard as anything on Burning Inside, North Face, Little White Lieback or West Face.) Sado-masochists can avoid the crux by climbing the slightly easier but dangerous flake on the left, trying to avoid touching the stacked choss directly above the belayer. After the flair, regroup at a ledge, then up and left to an overhanging hand crack which takes you to a 10' squeeze chimney and a drilled Lost Arrow.  A 4 Camalot can be placed at the back of the chimney, offering much better pro than the pin.  The chimney can be laybacked at 5.10 (?) R -- if you blow it, you'll bounce off the slab.  Better yet, remove your helmet and any extra gear and clothing and figure out the devious path through the chimney.At the top of the chimney unclip the 4 Camalot to avoid horrendous rope drag. 15' of crystally hands and cups get you the rest of the way to the belay, a perfect ledge with an uninspiring anchor: 1/4 bolt, drilled angle and tat; a good citizen would bring up a bolt kit to enhance this anchor which is also used by Stardust Cowboy.   From here either rap 100' to the previous belay ledge and then 50' using Kor Ingals anchors to the starting ledge or continue up Stardust Cowboy to the top.

The climb starts at the Kor- Ingalls. The traverse uses 4 pitches of established climbs and 5 new pitches.Might go in full day.This climb is dedicated to the desert climber and  guide book writer Eric Bjornstad.   P1. Pitch 1 Kor route.  5.6 140'  P2. Move belay to right to join P2 Arrowhead Left.  Climb this pitch to top of the Arrowhead(junction with Stardust Cowboy). 5.10. 100'  P3. The long Ed Webster bolt ladder of Stardust is followed, then up to the right to belay overlooking North Chimney. 110'  P4. Climb down 20', then over the massive chockstone near the top of P2 on the North Chimney.  A traverse right was made  across the slab on the right to a bolt at the end of the slab.Lowered down from this , and swing right onto ledges and 3 bolt belay at the top of pitch 2 on the North Face route.  110'   P5. Up ledges to the right, then climb down 12' to a beautifully exposed narrow slab traverse line (some of the bolts used to protect this pitch need hangers, nut and washers in place - bring a half inch wrench, or use wires).  Follow the slab crossing the Sun, Moon, and Stars route to an anchor overlooking The West Face route. 110' 5.9+ C1 (With pro now in place it should go all free)  P6. Lower 50' to an anchor on the West Face.  P7. Follow a thin crack up and right to the belay around the corner.  C1 5.3   P8. The long superb exposed crack is followed across the West Face to a belay overlooking the Kor route. 80' 5.9 C1  P9. From just up right of the belay, lower down a few feet to a horizontal crack. Follow it and then lower off into the Kor route. C1 170'Paul Ross.",

Start as for Kor-Ingalls.   P1.  Climb about 150' up KI.  At this point, 20-30' of easy scrambling past a major rap anchor, KI continues to angle rightwards up the corner while Black Sun go straight up a wide crack system.  From the point where the routes diverge, you will see a ledge about 80' upon the left side of the BS crack system.   P2. 5.8ish, 80'.  Wide crack climbing with some face holds and a variety of gear.  Belay on the ledge.   P3. 5.10, ~90'.  Continue up the crack system. About 20' up you hit a difficult section that can eat up your big gear.This quicly turns  into hands ands gets you to a stance at the base of the business, a 30' flare chimney with an offwidth crack in the back.  If you've squandered your 4.5 Camalot already, go back down and get it, because it's the essential piece through this entire section.  This section succumbs to left side in \"can opener technique\" -- squeeze chimney technique with the inside part of the body, knee/heel with the outside leg.  A couple of face holds facilliate the process.  The 4.5 can be easily walked along to maintain peace of mind.  The crack widens and gets easier in the last ten feet.  A 5 Camalot might protect this section which is too wide for the 4.5 and too flared for a decent Big Bro placement.  At the top of the flare, tunnel behind a chockstone and stand up on a good belay ledge.  The last few feet of the flare and the tunnel move can be avoided by going over the chockstone; this alternative looked harder and a lot hairier to me.   P4. 5.8 ~80'.  Head up a fist crack for 15'.  Squirm throughsome blocks and arrive at a stance (optional belay).  BS continues straight up through more 5.8 wide or you can traverse right to the standard KI face finish.",

P2 (after leaving KI) was a fun and slightly strenuous 5.8 that I liked better than its next door neighbor equivalent on KI.  You need to build an anchor in the cracks above the ledge.  Resist the urge to use your #2 camalots! P3 (crux) was a great pitch and very physical.  The \"5.10 fists\" crack down low was actually mostly small OW for me with some constrictions- I used up doubles of 3 and 3.5 camalots in it.  Then the crack angle decreases and you get a few thin hand moves to hands which was strenuous (#1 camalot) but short.  This gets you on a nice flat stance at the base of the business which, as mentioned above, is well protected with an old #4 and a new #5 (or old 4.5) camalot.  I totally got shut down by this section so Im guessing that to climb it at a low to mid 5.10 level of difficulty you have to have the correct technique dialed which I just didn't.  It was still very cool and I cant wait to go back and try again! After your #5 C4 tips out under the roof/massive chockstone the difficulty backs off as you maneuver the last few feet above your #5 to the roof and the tunnel move.  There is pro in the roof either large nuts or a #2 or larger C4.  It makes sense to belay on top of the chockstone/roof but to do it you need 2 #2 and 1 #3 C4 or vice versa and a #1.  If you dont, the best option I found was slinging the big boulder right on top of the chockstone with the ropes (everything back in the chimney is loose).  This is a bit awkward but works. P4 (if you are re-joining KI) didnt seem well described here.  We fount that it goes up the 3 to 3.5 camalot crack your belay is set in to a ledge on the left of the chimney where you traverse to the right side of the chimney tiptoeing over some big, loose blocks that threaten to chop your belayer.  Follow the easy crack up right to a traverse past an old but solid bolt rejoining KI on the ledge just above the P3 belay.  The 5.9ish direct finish reduces rope drag or with good rope management you can do the 5.7 standard finish.  Either way you belay from the final KI anchors below the summit. Above the initial crack on P4 the route is pretty unimpressive but gets you to the top which is your only option as there are no fixed anchors.  Overall, this is a great route even if you end up not having the prerequisite mastery of flaring OW chimney technique.  I can only imagine the fun meter pegs even higher if you do! For a rack, I think the recommendations above are great but I would have been happier to have had a third #2 C4. Oct 26, 2012",

OW on P3 protects well with a new #5 and new #6, or two new #5's.  OW aficionados and/or desert rats might be fine with walking just one new #5.  I was happy to have two #4's (new #4 preferable) for linking P2 & P3. We did this in 3 pitches by setting the belay right where Black Sun breaks away from Kor Ingalls (above the chain anchors).  If you link P2 & P3, back-clean and/or save that new #5 for up high.  Ideally save a #2 and #3 camalot (or 2 of each) for the belay after the crux OW as mentioned in earlier comment.  Not much else for gear except slinging the bird-poo slathered boulder that you're standing on.  Careful for the loose blocks when emerging from the tunnel (yep, the ones you standing near while belaying...).  Adventurous climbing - enjoy. Nov 5, 2017",

Bring doubles of micro and maybe a couple small offset nuts, and be prepared to pull some 5.10 face moves above gear. The last few moves felt similar to the 5.11- finish to Fine Jade.

This sunny route features lots of variety and would get three stars but for some fractured, not-fully-trustworthy rock on the last pitch.   Start as for Kor-Ingalls.  Scramble up 30' to the big ledge from which you can walk to the start of all other Castleton routes.  Walk about 50' right from K-I to a crack system which starts in blocky choss, enters a pod with a finger size crack in back, then exits the pod to a slab.   P1 (5.11b, 80')  Up fairly easily about 20 feet of choss to the pod.  Enter the pod, laybacking up thin fingers for a couple of moves. Undercling 3' left out of the pod and pull around the arrete and into another pod (technical crux).  Work up the second pod which though it has a decent hand crack in the back, is narrower than the first and thus awkward, and pull a hard move out of the slot onto the base of the slab.  A couple of non-trivial face moves protected by small gear lead to easier slabbing and the belay.   P2 (5.8, 60')  The second pitch of Black Sun.  Fist and offwidth.  This pitch crosses over KI.   P3 (5.10b, 100') The third pitch of Black Sun.  Flared chimney with 5\" crack in back.  Do the long version of this pitch, continuing about to a ledge about 20' above the block at the top of the chimney; the correct belay is about 10' below the first of four bolts.   P4. (5.10d, 90') Slightly necky (PG) getting to the first bolt.  Many of the holds through the first three bolts don't seem very well attached. The fourth bolt is about 25' past the third.  This stretch follows a thin crack followed by a hand traverse on a somewhat rotten seam and a couple of face moves; small nuts, micro cams and a couple of thin hand sized pieces comfortably protect this strech.  The crux is thin crimping on good rock after the fourth bolt and soon leads to an easy but exciting top out.  Be careful not to knock any of the plentiful loose rock from the top out onto the the numerous people and dogs who are likely to be hanging out at the base of Kor-Ingalls, directly below.

Follow the nice holds on the arete, past the second (last) bolt.  Scary small holds, a long way above the bolt lead up a panel to the big ledge.  The obtuse corner, just right is tempting but harder.  But set the belay right of Kor-Ingalls for best anchors and more importantly rockfall shelter.     From the ledge, rejoin Black Sun.

The bigger cams are nice for the belays.   Marsha Trout helped me bolt this a few days before Wyatt and I climbed the new pitches, Black Sun (5.10), and Burning Inside (5.10+).     All are rappel, hand drilled, 1/2\", plated, Rawl five-piece, power bolts.  After pounding the bolts in, the \"pounded bolt\" gets removed, and then a new painted one gets put in with a short handle wrench (to prevent over-torqued bolts).  So none of these four bolts were ever hammered upon.    I wanted to lead bolt it, but didn't want the inferior bolts produced. First I top-roped the upper part of the arete, while waiting for a turn at the KI rap anchor.  Next day, pitch two, I led up, marked the spot for bolt #1, and then braved the down-climb back to the \"passing lane\" chimney.  Finally, from rappel, I spaced the second bolt so that the level of runout is similar to Burning Inside.  For me the gnarliest bit is the run above the last bolt.  Wyatt Payne led it first, on a full South Face ascent, and liked it.   There are no bolted belays for the two pitches.  No need for them because there is good crack pro on the ledges.  Also, the first pitch anchor of Kor-Ingalls is the only location where a single 70m rope will get trail-users from the big KI ledge back to their packs.",

The crux pitch gets a fair bit of sun, yet the belay is positioned in the shade, and exposed to the wind. I'd recommend picking a day with low winds, and starting early or late to catch the crux pitch before it's had a chance to heat up, or after it's gone into the shade (mid-afternoon in the fall). Regardless, bring warm clothes for belaying the crux.   I know there was some online drama about this route's validity on curmudgeonclimbing.com (aka supertopo), and poor Sam took some very undeserved flak for this wonderful route, and his efforts.   I think anyone that has a problem with this route should go climb it. I'm sure they'll quickly be impressed, and realize that it is not an overbolted, thoughtless clip-up. In fact, it's a beautiful line, established in good taste, and does have some obligatory 5.12 climbing. The bolts are well camouflaged, and thoughtfully placed.  Regardless, there was plenty of precedent for routes with many bolts on Castleton long before this route was established; see Stardust Cowboy, Sacred Ground, etc.    The route has had at least five ascents. (Those are only the ones I know about, so I suspect there are more.) Despite some opinions to the contrary, I think it was a fantastic gift from Sam to the community, and I imagine it's popularity will only increase as word gets out about the route's high quality.    I've given French grades to confuse any curmudgeons.   P1: Easy climbing up a broken corner leads to some gear protected 6c lay backing in a corner, before an obvious traverse to the arete on the right. Tricky 7b/7b+ climbing up the arete past a few bolts gains a bolted belay. This is a tough pitch to onsight, particularly if there is no chalk. 7b/7b+ 33 meters.   P2: Spectacular climbing up the wild and exposed arete, with a crux low and high. 8a 32 meters.   P3: Cool bit of bouldery arete climbing off the belay leads to some fun and varied climbing up a leaning splitter. Belay on a comfortable ledge. 7b 20 meters.

I spent a winter working this line out and cleaning it. Really cool being  on the tower with rime ice and sometimes 2 feet of snow. Totally alone. That spring I got to where I could do all of it but one move. I could not get Moab peeps to come up and work it with me as much as I needed to get that pitch. It was going to take a lot of hikes up. Chris came over, got on it and loved it, and it was clear he could get it long before I did, so I threw all my effort in to him redpointing pitch 2. I like that kind of climbing. I consider climbing to usually be the ultimate team sport... you are so dependent on each other  to the point of life and death. If you know you will be better with someone else, then assist them as  much as possible. Chris got pitch 2 pretty quick. The rest of it was in the bag. I hope it will be a popular climb in years to come. Feb 10, 2018",

                "route_description": "P1 - this is a 140 foot, 5.easy pitch that splits into 4 sections. It starts at a wide dihedral crack/chimney system, goes up about 20 feet to a big ledge and continues past a bulge. Head slightly left to a fat dihedral/squeeze chimney that puts you onto another almost as big ledge (2 bolt rap anchor on the right). Continue up another short chimney to a belay at yet another big ledge (gear anchor). 5.6, 140'.P2 - head up the obvious crack system. It is weird and is more or less a double crack system. After ~20', the left crack goes up past a bolt and continues as Black Sun. The right crack is the original line; however, you could continue up Black Sun a bit further and angle right later. You'll figure-out how to do it. Double #4 Camalots and a bit of leap-frogging can make this more reasonable. Note, face climb around some large, loose blocks in the last 25' of this pitch. Be very careful with these, they shift. This pitch also takes a couple of bomber medium to large stoppers towards the top. At the end of this pitch, you will be placed at a ledge with a bolted belay. Oh yeah, it's honest 5.8, 100'.P3 - this is the business (true 5.9). Most of it is wide, but most of the protection is not. All I can say is don't get tunnel vision at the crux, which has the 3rd bolt near it. If you are a runt like me, you can squeeze into the chimney after the crux and feel secure. If not, there are face climbing options on polished calcite. There are protection options deep in the chimney. This pitch is where I got to hear my German friend curse in two languages - it was awesome. You arrive at a 3 bolt anchor. 5.9, 3 updated protection bolts & gear, 110'.P4 - you can either do 5.7 face with a hand or foot traverse right or the 5.similar chimney to the left. Definitely do the chimney if someone in your party is not a trad climber. You can easily watch them flail. This pitch is not too long compared to the 2nd and 3rd. There is a 2 bolt anchor just below the summit. You'll have to pee by now, so go ahead and get on the summit (on belay of course). 5.8, 80'.The route does go into the shade mid to late afternoon. It can be blazing hot in the quiet sun to unpredictably cold in the shade and wind, so be prepared. This route can be incredibly popular with even foreigners queuing up. Fortunately, you can descend from most points quite easily.It is of the utmost importance that you bring a gym/sport climber with you to follow you on this routes, especially if they are European. Doing this will make this route an even more memorable experience. Trust me. Additionally, do the route in the winter. You can get 1/2 price motel rooms in Moab and the crowds won't be there.Note: You can and should back-up every belay. Also, there is calcite all up and down this route. I hate calcite - except for one place where you agree with me.",

It should be noted that this cliff band is fun to down-climb in the dark, so you may not want to miss it. After bouldering up a short, exposed bit, head left towards the route - a big, fat dihedral on the south side as you approach the tower.",
                "route_protection": "A standard rack will work fine on this route to #4 Camalot; however, doubles may feel a bit heavy for 5.10 climbers. If you are a little squeamish, then you could bring Big Bros, #5-6 Friends, and/or color-coded 2x4s (reminiscent of the old days) cut to different lengths. There are three new bolts on the crux pitch, so don't despair. Bring 2 ropes to rappel.Finally, two shoulder gear slings for the leader and belayer will be vastly more appreciated than having gear dangling off your harnesses.In contrast to many desert routes, this climb utilizes calcite-coated Wingate sandstone for much of the route. This means the rock will seem stronger than average in strength; however, this also means it will be slick in spots due to polished calcite.",

I watched the second of the party in front of us try to climb the crux more like a chimney, falling multiple times.

I agree that at least  up to a #3  camalot is good to bring.  The third pitch really doesn't  require much big gear.  Leave the #5's and the Big Bros  at home. One more thing, stay near the outside of the chiminey on the last pitch. Although it is very easy, \"the Deuce\" Dawson and I had a humerous (for me) and painful (for him) experience. The Deuce was leading and decided to climb too far into the chiminey. Before he realized it, the chimney was too tight to slide out of and constricted above his head. The only way out was to go back down. The Deuce began a groveling slide back down when a #3 cam got wedged between a flake and his balls. \"AAAGGHHH !!*#*!%*!&!!!!!!\" hollered the Deuce. Five minutes later, now thouroghly castrated, he reclimbed the deceivingly simple chimney. Apparently I did not learn from the Deuce's misfortune, and I found myself sliding back down to reclimb the outtermost lip of the chiminey. My big head and butt could not be mashed down enough to fit through the constriction at the top. Once again, don't go too deep into the chimney on the last pitch.

If I had read your comment before doing the climb I'm sure I never would have done it! I'm sorry to sound so argumentative, but I think you do people (particularly 9+/10- leaders) a disservice by being so dismissive of the possibilities for gear.

I believe the lower chimney is avoidable by heading right around it, up a crack which, according to the Green guidebook goes at 5.5. Please note that I've said \"I believe\" twice here. I stayed in right most crack on the second pitch and got good pro, and found TCU placements inside the offwidth on P3. We used two ropes, a 60m and a 50m, and made three raps. Only one party was in front of us and they bivied at the base, and only one party followed us... everyone else, a steady line, was on the North Chimney! Apr 3, 2004",

If you go around the block to avoid the 1st one, watch the rope drag and be ready for some insecure moves and a bit of a run out. Overall, P1 = meh. P2 is awesome! I still can't stay in the main crack (wide, might have to walk the #4) and have to do a hard bouldery traverse into the double crack to the right after climbing about a body length. Sweet lieback/hands with great gear but increasingly slick feet until you can snag a horn that will drop about 2\" when you weigh it... Gets your heart running but it's solid. P3 is sick, quite spooky but there are only a few insecure moves on bolts and a bunch of solid small pieces in between (I placed #1 & #2 C3s and .4 & .75). Leave your large pieces and doubles at the belay, rack on the sides so you don't get too tangled in the offwidth, clip a slung block, do a couple hard moves to dive in the squeeze and get back out after the 3rd bolt. Good crimps on the calcite, wide stem between the arete and the left face, lots of air all around you, a few hard insecure moves and you can be back to the safety of the squeeze. Another exciting moves get you out to the belay. The last pitch is short but great, another chimney off the belay for good measure then a sweet flake with great gear brings you to the top.

This seemed to be easier. (I actually dislocated my knee on this pitch and thought really hard about lowering down, but I kept going without leading any other pitches). The crux 3rd pitch proved to be darn tough. I was told by someone that the crux can be easily stemmed and that there were huge jugs on both sides the whole way up. I did not find this to be true. There were a few  jugs on the left side only. To get to them I had to make some committing crimp moves on slippery calcite (I found that stuff more annoying than helpful). The jugs pulled me far enough to the left that I couldn't get a good stem. At least this part was quick. The pro. was pretty much the bolt until just past the crux. Small gear was found deep in the chimney but not until after the crux (a bit runnout). I also don't know why this is the \"classic\" route (maybe just the history). The climbing itself isn't all that special. I have been told that the North Chimney and North Face routes are WAY better! Still glad I did it though. But I would not repeat it. Dec 24, 2008",

The climbs are honestly like twins both formed from the same crack running through the entire formation it seems. K-I gets sun most of the day and was fairly sustained but I never felt like the moves got past 5.8. The questionable bolts on the infamous crux pitch had other gear nearby and were therefore not as scary as I thought they would be. North Chimney on the other hand didn't feel very sustained but the cruxes were pretty in my face. It was also cold and windy on that side of the formation, probably better to climb it on a hot day. I also never felt any of the moves got above 5.8 although it was a little strenuous and awkward at the beginning of each pitch. I lead the second pitch since I got the classic pitch on K-I and that spinning sheet metal hanger with not other gear in made me nervous. I might have gotten a little tunnel vision because I didn't see any other gear for a while and was practically pissing my pants. All in all I'd say both climbs are in the 5.8+/5.9- area. The crux of K-I is more technical I felt and was two moves that I could say felt 5.9. The North Chimney was just thuggery and the moves were mostly difficult in that I had to squeeze my little ass up there with my knees by my ears half the time. K-I is higher quality in some ways but much more crowded. Although when I climbed it we actually ended up waiting for two parties on the North Chimney and we only had to wait for one on K-I.

This then allows freeze-thaw, or just plain old water-softening, of the rock at a level beneath the surface. This then makes the bolts perhaps solid, but the rock itself very suspect. This process had no doubt happened to the hollow slab where the previous anchor was. IT is very hollow and probably wasn't so when the original anchor went in. The section of rock I chose was based on the solidness of the stone and the angle of the rock it was in... which was essentially vertical. Clearly I could see that this was directly above the crack. However, the main use of this anchor is for getting up the rock, not down... there is already a rap anchor for double rope raps on both the south side and the north side of the tower. As this was the most solid bit of rock, I felt I had to use it. Placing the anchor on the slab would have been very irresponsible. Again, the creation of this newer, improved anchor was not to create a single rope rap but to replace the aged, weakening anchor for upward ascent. I placed these two bolts in very hard stone that is vertical to overhanging, thus keeping most of the water from flowing into the rock. It was the best option in the given space and stone. Hopefully they will be there for a very long time. Steve, very sorry about your rope. Dec 7, 2009",

And all the warm, soft November sunshine didn't hurt. I hauled up a #5 C4 that was great for pitch 2 (right variation), but was never used on pitch 3. Instead, it's bulkiness only managed to make the crux that much more difficult. I agree with some of the other posters, the biggest gear you need is definitely 2 #4 C4's. Pitch 2 would be way scary without the big gear. This climb will wear you down so that the moves on the second half will feel harder. For the crux, I tried to offwidth, but couldn't get past that tricky bulge (I was just too damn tired and for the life of me my legs didn't want to stem). After about 15 minutes of offwidthing and going nowhere, I thought I was going to fail from exhaustion when Layton Kor's ghost appeared and I aided off the bolt past the crux. It's a lot easier that way wink*wink. Also, it was an incredible feeling standing in a sling out on the face and looking down at all the open air around me. Next time, I'll just suck it up and stem. After the crux, if you're skinny like me you can squeeze inside the chimney and use the crack that runs up the back. I think I used a #1 C3 and a .75 C4. Also, at this point the chimney starts to sprout good hands and feet. My partner couldn't make the squeeze and had to stay outside for the rest of the pitch. Nov 29, 2010",

The #6 will fit in the crack at one key section of the 3rd pitch.  The bulkiness of the large cams might have bothered my 2nd, but honestly the cams spent too much time in the rock to get in my way!  I'd describe myself as confident/solid on 5.9 offwidth and chimneys, but not so confident that I don't want good pro. People saying things like \"large cams only get in the way\" or \"the 3rd pitch is crazy run out\" are all wrong IMO.

When the slickness becomes a problem, just grab the inside corner edge (where the other chimney intersects) and jam your foot in the crack on the outside corner of the two intersecting chimneys. Ratchet-ratchet. P2 - 2 guidebooks descriptions & topos talked about 2 cracks, so I was confused with seeing 3 options. I tried the middle crack, which was a tricky & wide #4 Camalot Crack. After I saw my cam slide down the crack as I yanked on it to test the placement, I lost my nerve on that option and stepped over to the right-most set of cracks (double cracks). These were much better! That is until I got to a projecting block that you have to pull on. I was halfway over it when it started moving, so I immediately retreated, and stepped back left where the middle crack was a more manageable size and had some constrictions to stop a cam from sliding. I carefully face climbed around the loose blocks to the left and battled the now bad rope drag to the anchors. I almost say this pitch was harder than P3. It at least was less secure in moves & pro and had worse fall potential! P3 - Took me a while of trying to get my hips through the tightest part of the offwidth before I relented and followed the faceholds on the outside. Wild stemming on calcite. Don't slip! Chimney is a breeze and there is a finger crack that goes all the way up on the inside. P4 - Starts loose but quickly gets better. Straightforward & has good pro.

About 6 feet above the last bolt I was able to place a #3 cam...after testing the bolt when I fell trying to use friction on the calcite...comical!

When you get into the chimney past the bolts, and you look up and see absolutely nowhere to protect, don't fret; I plugged in a blue alien and a yellow C3 in a crack on the main wall side of the chimney. After that you're golden. Have fun! Oct 2, 2013",

I give the following comments so others like me can gauge what to expect. These days, I'm mostly a gym climber from the DC area and lead fairly solid 5.10 face and buckety type routes once I get a few days into a trip.  I haven't done offwidths, chimneys, or even much crack for that matter, for decades, several decades. (Yes I'm getting up there in age.) Even though I never came close to falling on any ptich, I found KI hard; this was undoubtedly due to my thoroughly solid lack of technique, exacerbated from arriving from sea level only 1.5 days earlier (Castleton is 6,600+ ft).  This made the beautiful approach feel a bit strenuous. The squeeze chimney on the first pitch is ridiculously slippery, and I found myself facing the wrong way and off-widthing up the back of it.  The problem is that it is so tight back there, it's hard to move one's feet up. The cracks of the second pitch felt fine, and one can avoid pulling hard on the loose block by doing some face and jam moves.  The third pitch climbs well if you start off facing the cliff, stay out of the chimney, and stem/face climb the calcite, which has a friction coefficient similar to snot.  As I neared the top, I had to turn around and chimney with may back to the cliff, before exiting out onto the block with some layback and foot smears.  It all felt OK to second, but I was glad I did not lead these pitches. For me, the chimney moves were thuggish and on them I sometimes had to catch may breath after only a few moves.  Part of it was mental:  I spent a lot of time thinking because in the back of my mind, if I couldn't make the move feel secure and relatively easy, I felt I must be doing something wrong.  But the bottom line is that this type of climbing requires full body exertion, unlike the stufff that merely puts a little pump on your forearms. So overall, I think 5.9+ is the right grade.  Have fun! Mar 18, 2014",

Although I knew it was south-facing, I was still impressed by how warm and comfortable the climbing was. There were moments in the chimneys that got a little chilly, but overall it was quite pleasant. 10/10 recommend the winter ascent. With regards to gear, I took a single rack from blue TCU to #4C4 and a half-rack of nuts. I felt the choice of taking a second #4 pretty much relied on whether you committed solely to the left crack system on pitch two or not. With one #4, I started on the left, moved to the right crack after several feet of humping the rock separating the two into submission, and ultimately committed back to the left towards the top. A #5 or 6 would have protected the flare on pitch four, but the extra weight and hassle of scraping it through all the chimneys to even get to that point made me entirely complacent with just running it out. I initially felt like it was a mistake to take the nuts, but was pretty happy to have them after dipping back into the chimney above the crux move on pitch three, where I was able to jimmy in and equalize two small guys before pushing upwards. Without the bolts protecting the crux, I would never have done the stemming that turns the crux into a one-two sport climbing move. The consequence of a fall without them would have been heinous, as there is definitely no obvious bomber gear protecting the portion up to the crux. Even if there was gear, the nature of the fall would have involved falling into the off-width, which I would envision in myself as something that involved a tangling and scraping of my legs until something caught and flipped me about, with a high likelihood of slamming my head on something. Of note, I have never before appreciated having shoulder gear slings quite like I appreciated them on this climb. Having the gear on my harness would have really sucked (namely for pitches 1, 3, and 4). We rapped the route with a single 70m. Despite the insanely bomber anchors, this route will definitely eat your rope. In fact, I climbed through a stuck rope on pitch 3. When pulling your rope on pitch 3, absolutely pull from the right stand with a strong whip in the final seconds as it passes through the chains; this will greatly decrease the chance of the rope falling down the off-width portion and increases the chance it will slide down the face.

P4's mild face climbing is so enjoyable after grunting and heaving your way up the last few pitches! I feel the overall crux of this climb is when you inevitably discover that your body is oriented in the squeeze the wrong way and you have to find a way to make a 90 degree reposition - pretty sure I had to do this on every single pitch...

There's a decent chance you're dumb enough to go up it anyway, so here's what you should expect: Pitch 1: Low quality, uninspiring scrambling up and through a squeeze chimney. Inexplicably chossy. This pitch has potential to have the absolute best climbing on the entire route if you start at a short hand crack below the main ledge most people seem to start at. At this point, your best bet for a quality day is to climb this hand crack and then go climb the North Chimney (or walk back to your car). Pitch 2: Cryptic wide climbing wandering up through more uninspiring, chossy terrain. Maybe hard to protect, but that's less bothersome than the fact that it's a bad pitch that you shouldn't waste time climbing. Pitch 3: Squeeze chimney. Slick calcite, more uninspired and cryptic nonsense; hope you didn't bring a day pack or a thick waistline. There are bolts through the crux, and then you'll fiddle with gear in the back of the chimney so you can feel a little better running out the last 30 feet to the anchors. Not horribly hard, not horribly scary, but just...not good. Maybe two stars. Maybe. Pitch 4: Head up to a chimney and either run it out up more thrutchy squeeze or run it out up the face on the right. Again, not hard and not awfully scary (well, don't fall, or you'll hit the ledge and get hurt), but really uninspiring and forgettable. The Kor-Ingalls isn't bad because it's runout, or bad because it's hard, or bad because it's a series of squeeze chimneys and nonsense; it's bad because it's just a run-of-the-mill bad route. Here is the full list of reasons you should consider it: - It follows an obvious line up the tower - It has some history - You like squeeze chimneys and would like to climb a low-quality one so you appreciate the high-quality ones more It might be 5.10, it might be R/X, whatever, argue that until the cows come home.

Hopefully you know how to take the road out to Castleton Valley (out UT 198). Take this road for 15.2 Miles, then turn right onto Castlevalley road. Follow this road for 4.7 Miles, then take a sharp left onto a small bumpy dirt road to a parking lot. Take the trail directly out of the parking lot into a small slot canyon. After the canyon, you will find a road that goes horizontally across the trail. Take this road LEFT down a short hill.  At the bottom of the hill, take a right by a sign with an arrow and a cairn. Follow this obvious trail all the way to the tower. This approach takes about an hour or slightly more. The climb was great. All of the difficulties were directly on with what was listed. 2nd pitch was more sustained and ended up being a little more difficult than the 3rd pitch, however the 3rd pitch had an interesting crux. 4th pitch was so fun and had some puckering exposure. A #5 Cam would come in handy a few times, and we used a few smaller tricams, one nut passive placement, and the rest of the placements consisted mainly of .4,.75,1,2,3,4 camalots. We rapped off the same route with a single rope 3 times, than with a double rope the last time. DO NOT RAPPEL ABOVE THE FIRST ROUTE ON THE LAST RAPPEL. Rappel over the left face of the pitch (facing outward toward the parking area). All the anchors are bomber. Have a great time climbing this beast. Bring a ton of water, and run a tag line for packs if you bring them, otherwise you will get stuck in the chimney.

P2 it's less tricky, probably tougher if you're not as used to jamming. P3 is a bit more delicate as you're chimney (and then face) climbing on calcite.

The only thing I'd clarify is that the first anchor you rap to (about 40 feet down and left from the triple chains at the top of the North face) is just hangers. There are no rings or chains, just two burly hangers about 6\" apart that are rounded on the inside which facilitates smoothly pulling your rope.

Don't use the 2,3, or 4 for the gear anchor atop P1. We placed an average of ~5 pieces per pitch because the climb is so broken up, and the crux pitch currently has 2 slung chockstones and 3 bolts. This climb is much lower quality/less sustained than the North Chimney but still a good time, feels more \"adventurey\". Sep 27, 2022",

We did the approach in the dark (1 hour) and arrived just before sunrise with no one else around. The first pitch squeeze chimney felt more like 5.8 to me, though the overall characteristic of this route was like old school Yosemite climbing so some OW/squeeze technique will be helpful. A #4 for the second pitch was definitely helpful for the wide crack and there is a fair amount of fixed gear/slings/cords throughout the route. The 3rd pitch crux can be stemmed through over a nice bolt, but your feet are on some super insecure calcite that is a bit unnerving if you haven't climbed on this rock before (feels like glass). Great summit and a single 70 m rap down Sacred Ground is pretty straight forward. For the first station which is far climbers left from the summit, I aimed for a block about 15-20 ft climbers right of the anchors and walked up an easy ramp to the anchors rather than tried to swing to the anchors. After rappelling, there was a gap in groups on North Chimney so we headed up that for an awesome day of climbing. Both are awesome routes, I think the climbing is slightly better on North Chimney but Kor Ingalls has the history. If you are deciding between the two, I would pick which of these means more to ya...or whichever is open! Oct 26, 2023",

We rapped it in the dark, and once we got to the base it was not at all obvious how to get down, you can't judge depth and most of it is completely cliffed out. A group from North Chimney was there and showed us the way they came up, but it was even difficult for them to find it. I was under the impression that you could walk around the base of the tower to Kor, but we didn't find that to be the case. If you are going to be rapping this in the dark make sure you know how to get down the scramble from North Chimney, you could end up in a pretty dicey situation in the dark.

The belay takes hand size cams.P3- Climb up the hand crack up to a stemming move at the top of the chimney which gets you to a ledge. Climb up easy ground to a ledge where you join the Kor Ingalls.

While I think climbing history should be honored, it's also conceivable that the first ascentionists, for whatever reason, rated it a grade easier than it should have been. This happens today and it happened back then. Some do it deliberately, some not. But either way, it makes sense to update ratings based on how the route feels to the average climber. It's been done to Bastille Crack and Stettner's Ledges, among others, for better or for worse; but in the end I feel it does a service to the climb and to those who climb it to give it a rating that's as accurate as possible. As for gear, doubles of cams up to a #3 Camalot and a set of stoppers(rarely used), plus a #4 Camalot worked well for me. I also used a screamer on the old and extremely sketchy-looking bolt, which I backed up with the #4, however, if you have a #4.5 you'll be able to get it in at about bolt-level, instead of having to go a little higher to place the #4. Also, the anchor at the top of pitch 2 is fixed with 2 pins and an old cam or something. Be extra careful when pulling on to the ledge as you exit the main chimney on pitch 3 as it's littered with rocks of all sizes right to the edge, and the jumble of chockstones above this, just before the belay ledge looks like an accident waiting to happen.

It looks much too wide even for a #4.5. I own a #4.5 but not the #4.  I agonized over whether or not to bring it right up until we started hiking and ultimately decided againsed it.  We were trying to be fast and light since temps were getting up to 100* on Tuesday.  We were back at the van by 11:30am, thankfully.  But, I surly would have been glad if I had the 4.5 at the time... If you find yourself here w/o a large cam, a medium sized piece can be plugged into the crack, eight or so feet below the bolt (deep in a chimney).  Not the best placement but better than nothing.

(Thundering skys convinced us to back off at the top of the second pitch.)  I would certainly give the first two pitches three stars as they were fun, contained a variety of moves, and kept me honest. After reading all the debate on this page regarding which cams to bring or leave behind, and since I am a much better hiker than climber, I brought both a #4.5 and #4 camalot on this climb.  As stated above, the 4.5 fits great right at the bolt.  I walked the 4.5 up until I could reach up and slide the #4 in.  I then walked the #4 up and placed it behind a chockstone with a long runner.  The 4.5 would have made a great first piece of gear right off the second belay as well.  I enjoyed the security of having the 4.5 in addition to the old bolt while sliding up that OW.  Not everyone needs that kind of security.  It is a nasty fall though if that bolt were to shear and you didn't have it backed up with anything. As far as the rating goes I would call the route sustained 5.8 with two 5.9 cruxes.  We were actually surprised at how sustained the first pitch felt even with so many great rest stances.  I can see calling it 5.8 though as many desert routes have conservative grades. Next time we will step it up a notch and tackle the Kor-Ingels route.  Need a little more OW training time first though. :) Jun 23, 2003",

Just stay IN the chimney even though it looks kinda crappy. P-4 belay is the obvious flat spot between the main tower and the pillar to yr left. There are no anchors.

Enthralled by Moab and eager to climb after a couple of days at the Creek.  I buddied up with these guys Scott And Adam who I'd met at Potash Road. I led the first pitch but when Scott was half way up he got a bad feeling and told me to lower him off despite my protests. (Later I was soo glad he did). Instead Adam came up climbing quickly and efficiently. I led the second and was so impressed that I handed him the rack for the third. About fifty feet up the third pitch Adam accidentally kicked a couple of milk crate sized blocks lose that wizzed passed me by inches. Startled I screamed ROCK ROCK ROCK and Scott barely got out of the way at the base as the Rocks smashed onto the large boulder at the base. Thank God he prophetically lowered as one of us would have surely been hit at the top of the second pitch. Shaken but OK we summited only to find that our second rope had been cut over half way thru by the rockfall. The mini-epic continued when our good rope got stuck on the rappel and I made the decision to leave it as darkness was now setting in. (unknowingly we rapped the chimney instead of the Kor-Ingalls, Rap K-I or N. face) We now had to rap the last two pitches with a rope that was marginal at best. I remember rapping off the end of the rope at the same time I grabbed the slings at the top of the first pitch for the rope was barely long enough. I must have the best guardian angel out there because we all survived intact. I actually went back the next day and bribed the only two climbers there to recover my new supersafe from the route.

The climbs are honestly like twins both formed from the same crack running through the entire formation it seems. K-I gets sun most of the day and was fairly sustained but I never felt like the moves got past 5.8. The questionable bolts on the infamous crux pitch had other gear nearby and were therefore not as scary as I thought they would be. North Chimney on the other hand didn't feel very sustained but the cruxes were pretty in my face. It was also cold and windy on that side of the formation, probably better to climb it on a hot day. I also never felt any of the moves got above 5.8 although it was a little strenuous and awkward at the beginning of each pitch. I lead the second pitch since I got the classic pitch on K-I and that spinning sheet metal hanger with not other gear in made me nervous. I might have gotten a little tunnel vision because I didn't see any other gear for a while and was practically pissing my pants. All in all I'd say both climbs are in the 5.8+/5.9- area. The crux of K-I is more technical I felt and was two moves that I could say felt 5.9. The North Chimney was just thuggery and the moves were mostly difficult in that I had to squeeze my little ass up there with my knees by my ears half the time. K-I is higher quality in some ways but much more crowded. Although when I climbed it we actually ended up waiting for two parties on the North Chimney and we only had to wait for one on K-I.

Rack: doubles to #1 C4, triples 2/3 C4, 1 #4, 1#5.  The triples felt adequate on the first pitch as I placed a few more 3's towards the bottom and the majority of the 2's near the end of the pitch.  Used the #5 C4 at the bolt on the 2nd pitch and the 4 later in the 2nd pitch. The Climb: Excellent first pitch! After multiple days at the creek this pitch felt much easier than what I was expecting, I agree with the statement that there are multiple 5.8 moves but with really good rests, just keep your eyes out for feet and be creative.  Crux wasn't bad at all, really good gear just keep getting your feet up. Belay at bolts 5.8 2nd pitch wide from the get go and with a manky bolt to boot! I wouldn't trust that thing, just have your 2nd haul the 5 for the rest of the route and feel confident in the fact that you don't need to use this thing.  Overall the wide moves weren't bad just trust your feet and it'll be over before you know it.  This pitch varied several times for me and I actually felt like this pitch was harder than the first.  I don't know if that was from the fact that i'd been climbing in the creek for the week so the first pitch was easy or the fact that this pitch was more mentally taxing because I felt like I was going to die from a chockstone at any second!  At the very end of the chimney climb to the right under the massive chockstone and build a belay on a small ledge.  Belay for me took a 1, .5 and blue tcu.  Careful to not knock rocks off the ledge.  5.8+ 3rd pitch was the forgettable one of the climb which we linked into the last for a great final pitch.  The north chimney pitch ascends the corner under a big chockstone to a ledge where it joins with the KI.  The last pitch of the KI gives you great flake face climbing up over some exposure to the bolted belay just below the top.  Really a fun way to finish the route after climbing up the forgettable 3rd pitch.  Definitely combine 3 & 4. Spent some time on the summit and then did 3 double 60M rope raps down the North Face to the bags. Overall a great way to summit castleton and in my opinion more than the first pitch is worth the trip I can honestly say i've never climbed anything like the 2nd pitch, go to the summit!

Its about convenience. Its more convenient to clip a bolt than place a cam, so people want the bolt. I again say that the bolt is not necessary and FA did not have it. He also didn't have any cams and lacked sticky rubber. So carry the cam and ignore the bolt. The really bad bolt. In my opinion, if you find 10- desert pretty hard, your rack should be a double set of cams with a couple extra wide hands pieces and maybe cut down on the finger pieces, four slings with biners, and perhaps a small set of nuts.

I was way up there, wasn't motivated to descend to check it out and give it a go, so I never saw it...but she is pretty good at gear removal. For the motivated \"Heat Of The Summer\" Desert climbers out there, I am quite sure the next party up will be pretty stoked at the find!

If you are like me and get nervous running it out in the dessert, you wont regret having triples for hand size pro on P1. That being said, it is also easy to protect with finger size pieces if you don't have triples for hands. Also, we brought a #6 and were very happy to place it right by the bolt in P2. It fit like a glove and made the awkward stemming a lot more comfortable. We got confused where P2 actually ended and the belay for P3 began, so we ended up just building a belay at the very top of the chimney.  It seems like it would have been much better to belay where the two pitons are (one in the left crack, one in the right). This might be obvious to everyone else, but it wasn't for me, so I thought I'd mention it. From there, it's pretty easy to go all the way to the summit, just bring some slings to reduce the drag. We rapped the North Face route in two raps with two 70 meter ropes tied together. We went from the summit to the first set of chains at a nice ledge, and from there to the ground. If you want to not drag a second rope with you to the summit, just wait up there until another party shows up and rap with them. Mar 21, 2016",

It's pretty disgusting. Sep 24, 2017",

Rap 1 goes from the top of the tower to a set of intermediate rap bolts about 30-40 feet down and to climbers left. Rap 2 goes from those bolts to a nice ledge with chains. Rap 3 goes to another ledge with nice chains, and rap 4 makes it to the bottom, with a few feet extra to spare. I don't think you could do this with a 60M. DO NOT try go from the summit to the first ledge in a single rap, missing the intermediate rap bolts, or you'll find yourself a few feet short of the chains. If you have double 70M ropes, you can go from the summit to the first ledge (first set of chains, skipping the intermediate rap bolts), and from that ledge you can go to the ground.

We had a single 70m rope and we're heading down the North face route but didn't know to go to the first set of chains that are, apparently, well to the left on the first rappel. For the first rappel we  had to stop on a ledge about 10 feet up and 30 feet right of the chains. Fortunately, I had most of the rack, so I built an anchor, my partner lowered down, we pulled the rope and we belayed each other over to the chains. The rest of the rappels on the North face are pretty straight-forward. Moral of the story: if you only have one 70m rope, stop after probably 20 ft and look for chains that are supposedly on your left, don't rappel the full rope length on the first rappel.

I'd recommend bringing another rope or a tag line, you'll be happy you did.

He had assumed that I had placed it on the first ascent.  I wasn\u2019t aware of it until I climbed the route again many years later with my kids.  I wasn\u2019t excited to see the bolt, especially since it seemed manky.  But it is there.  And if it is removed there will still be a man made hole in the rock.  At this point with all of the traffic on the route, I would support someone replacing the bolt, using the same hole location, with a modern 1/2\u201d 4\u201d long bolt that folks can trust. I see on here that there is a lot of discussion about the route being 5.8 or 5.9.  The 5.8 rating comes from my route description in the AAJ.  Some history is needed.  The hardest route I had climbed was the North Ridge of the Grand Teton the previous summer that was rated 5.7.  I was really strong from driving truck that winter and had a stellar day when I climbed the North Chimney.  I knew that it was harder than the North Ridge, so I rated it 5.8.  I didn\u2019t have a clue about 5.9. It is a wonderful route.  More trivia about the first ascent is in my article in Summit magazine. Jul 26, 2021",

The #6 C4 cam protects the most difficult moves by the bolt on P2. (I think there was some confusion above as older comments reference the old \"Camalot\" style sizes.) The crack narrows above the bolt and if you want to stay on TR the whole time, bring a #5 C4 cam to continue bumping. However, a finger cam may be placed a bit higher and therefore I agree with others that the #6 is adequate on its own. I believe the route has cleaned up over time as the first 2 pitches are clean and spectacular -- reminiscent of the upper pitches of Northeast Buttress, Higher Cathedral Rock in Yosemite. There are loose rocks on P3 that warrant caution but they are not in a place you or the rope would likely touch. P.S.

If you rap from the Pitch 1 anchors with 2 ropes (which I believe is typically necessary) - the knot tying them together WILL almost certainly get stuck in the crack (at the crux bulge) as you try to pull them. We had to climb the pitch again to fix this. This could have been avoided the first time by doing the following: First member(s) of the party rap the route normally. Then have them pull the knot-side rope down with the assistance of the person at the top until the knot is below the bulge where the rope falls into the crack. The person at the bottom then fixes the side of the rope with the knot to a block on the ground (or to themselves) so that the person on top can descend the strand without the knot. Once everyone is on the ground, continue pulling the rope on the side with the knot. Our rope-end STILL got hung up in that spot after it came through the chains, but luckily because there was no knot we were able to tug it through. Hopefully this can help someone who finds themselves in a similar situation! Jun 3, 2022",

I can\u2019t see how you could get a #5 to work near the relic bolt without getting into the business. -Speaking of the #5, I found myself 50 feet past the offwidth wishing I had back cleaned it - you could bump it in the right crack almost all the way to the belay.  Other gear exists in the chimney, but is more tricky. -There\u2019s a fixed bong at the P2 belay.  Hand size and finger size pieces can be made to work for this anchor. -We rapped the K-I with two 70s in two raps from summit to base.  K-I seems a better choice if it\u2019s windy.

This route seemed to be more popular though it could have just been the day. The first pitch was awesome, sustained crack climbing with a little bit of everything and I would definitely put at 5.9. I found the initial moves off the ground to be the hardest, with the bulge before the anchors being almost as hard. Currently, there is quite a bit of fixed gear throughout the pitch. Of note, the ledges on this route are significantly smaller than those on Kor Ingalls so if multiple groups are stacking up, you are gonna get really cozy with your new best friends. The 2nd pitch wide portion was actually the hardest moves for me of both routes, but I do very little wide climbing these days. Interestingly, I saw the groups before me yarding on the Star drive bolt protecting this section so maybe it's ok...I bumped a #5 and felt very secure, though gassed. The rest of this pitch is great and maintains consistent climbing of various types (crack, liebacking, chimney). We ended up climbing pitch 3 to the top which didn't result in too much rope drag and my partner and I were able to keep communicating. Rapped down Sacred with a single 70 m (beta in Kor Ingalls post). We had a great time on both routes, though I enjoyed this one slightly more for the more unique, sustained climbing and styles. You can't go wrong with either though, so whichever is open is the one I would hit...or with a little luck, do both like we did! Oct 26, 2023",

Easy but insecure -- if you blow it, you fall onto the slab -- climbing leads to a fixed pin, and an easy face traverse left.  Steep 5.9ish cracks lead to a traverse left to the anchor.

Follow the crack up the calcite covered face to the roof(crux), turn the roof via a left leaning crack and proceed up and left to another bolted belay on a excellent ledge.    Pitch three 10b - Move right and up to bolt, then do some tricky face moves left into a right facing corner. Follow corner to another well bolted belay at a good stance.    Pitch four 12b - Time for some sport climbing. Move up and right, power/finesse your way past a small bulge into some technical calcite pulling. Take a good rest at the horizontal and get ready for crux #2. Move up past more technical calcite sidepulls and pinches to another good horizontal.

I've done both 11 starts and the 11c is amazing and felt very similar to the 11b in difficulty but is a lot better.  Here is the sad news: I climbed this with my wife yesterday 5/30/16 and ripped off the chunk that forms a nice super chalked up crimp at the start of the 1st boulder problem of the 5.12 pitch.  We had waited for 4 days after rain and the rock felt bone dry.  I had tried this once before and remember thinking about how it was destined to blow off since there was a visible crack around it.  Luckily no one was below us and I retried it and it still goes free with the same grade and what remains is a very nice pinch on solid rock.  In my opinion the climb is a little nicer since the suspect rock is gone.  The clip that was made from that crimp may be a hair harder.

Use either the North Chimney approach or the first 25 foot pitch of Kor-Ingalls to get to the big ledge.   Pitch one is steep and clean all the way, 5.11-.  The crux requires Indian Creek style thin hands endurance.  It ends with steep 5.9 hands to Ed's first bolt.  From there climb up left to the big ledge below pitch two of Arrowhead Left.  This bolt helps protect the second.  If your skipping the bolt ladder finish, then Kor-Ingall's lowest anchor is the best option back to the trail with a single 70m rope.     Pitch two begins with traversing back right to the pitch one bolt and then moving up a 5.7 arete onto the white face.  A fragile 5.10 lieback is done and some loose blocks may need passing before the belay ledge is reached.   Pitch three is the bolt ladder.   Pitch four traverses right into the top of the North Chimney and finishes via Kor-Ingalls.  Careful climbing and communication may be needed to keep climbers in the North Chimney safe from loose stuff.  There are no anchors on the sub-summit, just dangerously loose rocks.

Approach as for North face.  From the ledge where NF starts, traverse right about 50' to the WF.   P1. 150' 5.9+ (stout).  Up the crack system with lots of cups and some stemming.  Carefully pass some loose blocks in an overhang, eventually ending up at a good stance.  This pitch consumes a lot of gear.  Belayer should be well sheltered for this pitch.   P2. 80' 5.8.  Continue to a belay with modern bolts.   P3 100' 5.11-.  Starts with a 5.9 squeeze chimney.  You can place the #3 BigBro in the back of this but should probably backclean it to avoid ropedrag.  Exit the chimney though a roof with hands.  Some easier ground leads to the business, a 5\" section which is well protected with a 4.5 Camalot.  I found the hardest part of this section was an offwidth move at the start; after that, aggresive laybacking gets you quickly through to good hands. The line traverses right some to a five foot section of exposed hands which ends up on a ledge.  There is an unnerving breadbox size loose block sitting on this ledge; if the coast is clear, you'd be doing a public service by cleaning this block.  The route then goes back left, be careful to arrange your pro so that there is no danger of the rope prying the block off.  After heading left, for a stretch of 5.9ish hands the route angles right again on easy, wide terrain to a belay at a stance in a left-facing corner.   P4 60' 5.10-.

                "route_description": "Buddha's Delight is among the best climbs I have ever done. It is a stunning line, particularly pitch three, the \"Buddha's Belly\" pitch.  There are several pitches on this climb longer than 35 meters, along with an overhanging pitch, so the best decent is Choir Boyz.  If you plan to project it, bring a tag line so you can make it back to the anchors on pitches 3 and 4.   The climb starts on the looker's right third of the Convent, in the large, right facing dihedral.  You will see a belay bolt next to a small roof.   Pitch One (30 M, 5.11) - This pitch was originally a scary lead 'cuz it was full of detached flakes (which was our first inspiration to name it after Buddhism - non-attachment, get it?). Some bolts may seem unnecessary, but they were originally placed on lead due to dreadful gear in sketchy rock.  However, it cleaned up nicely and became an awesome pitch, particularly moving past the \u201cpinned\u201d block.  From the belay bolt, mantle up through the choss until you are below the corner (you can use a big cam here then leave it on the ground as the second cleans). Head up and right past a bolt for an exciting 5.10+ face move, or stay left in the shattered corner past a pin for some 5.11 stemming. Gain the primary corner and move up past the bolts until you are below the block.  This block is a bit intimidating, but we pinned it to the main wall with a 3 ft. rod of stainless steel, so it should be bomber.  If the route is not getting much traffic, this block does produce silt, but cleans up nicely with traffic. Use the face holds on the block to move up and right to the anchor.  (Be gentle with the holds because it is not the best sandstone, and underclinging the block is closer to 5.12.)   Pitch Two (30 M, 5.10-) \u2013 This is a stellar dihedral.  Classic desert climbing, very fun.   Pitch Three (37 M, 5.12) \u2013 The Buddha\u2019s Belly! It is not everyday you find a bulging headwall in the desert, so prepare yourself for a wild ride and a unique desert climbing experience!  Head up the crack 15\u2019 or so, until it kind of runs out.  Make a moderate but airy move left until you can gain the crack splitting the Buddha\u2019s Belly.  Move up through the nice hands as it gets steeper.  Now for the business- make your way through the crux with thin hands as the crack cuts right through the face.  Keep your wits about you as the crack heads up again, in fingers and tight hands, and get back above your feet.  Put those blue camalots to use in the upper section through the small roof.  The belay is off to the left, and if you desire you can place a cam high in the crack before leaning left to grab the anchor. You cannot rappel this pitch without a tag line tied to the anchors below, seriously.   Pitch Four (40 M, 5.11) \u2013 This would be a stellar line in the creek any day, so don\u2019t think the fun is over!  Start up the fun, mellow hand crack until it gains the headwall.  Move through fun hands up the steep headwall as the crack gets thinner and thinner.  Enjoy the \u201czig zags.\u201d And be sure to look around for foot holds outside of the crack.  As the crack fades, delicately move to the left until you are below the right facing corner.  Remember to save some hand sized gear for this upper section.  Gain the ledge and move left to the anchor. This is a 40 M pitch, so keep that in mind if you want to rap it.   Pitch Five (25 M, 5.9) \u2013 there are some fun moves at the beginning of this pitch, but towards the end move with care through the big blocks.  Move up and left through the horizontal features passing a fixed pin and a bolt.  Then head straight up through the loose blocks until the comfortable belay ledge.   Pitch Six (10 M, 5.8) \u2013 this is more like a half pitch, and is set back a ways from pitch 5, which makes it difficult to link.  Move up through the 5.8 hand crack until you gain the summit!   Decent \u2013 again, the best decent is Choir Boyz on the north end of the convent.  Given the long pitches, and the overhang on the Buddha\u2019s Belly, it is tricky to rappel, even with a tag line, because you would have to leave it tied on pitch three, making the pitch 4 rappel tricky as it is 40 meters. So, walk north 15 minutes or so, until you gain the highest point on the NORTH end of the Convent. Then, head South (towards Castleton) down the hill for about 50 yds. and look for a cairn below a mushroom roof. From the cairn you will see a distinct ledge and a new and improved rap down Choir Boyz. One 70 gets you down. IMPORTANT - stick to the corner when arriving at last rap station, otherwise it is easy to find yourself swinging in the breeze.",

We could not find information online or in any books about this climb.   We climbed this route twice fall of 2016. All anchors are bolted well with good enough tat. This line is beautiful corner and is immediately above you when you hike up to the convent. We linked pitches and did it in 3. 1 and 2 link well, the rest have decent drag.   Pitch 1: 5.12-, Crux off the deck. Super thin corner for 20 feet leads to a short easy chimney. The move getting out of the chimney roof was not freed but felt pretty hard and awkward. finish on off fingers and hands   Pitch 2: 5.10+, Great pitch, tight hands through an overhang leads  up the corner. The corner is variable but widens to #5 cam. We found 2 #4s and 1#5 helpful on this pitch. Hand stack and jam up this beautiful pitch!   Pitch 3: 5.11+, The corner thins down up to fingers and leads to a large roof that seams out. My last piece was blue metolious. Pull a cool move around the roof. Then exposed face traverse left to a hand crack and mantle up to base of sport pitch. I placed a very small piece temporarily to protect mantle at end of this pitch. This pitch is wild and exposed!   Pitch 4: Sport pitch, 5.11c, Clip 4 bolts and pull technical and balancy moves. Great movement! lead up and right on easy terrain. This is where it gets tower weird. Ill describe the way we went: Mantle and traverse 30 feet left on flat ground. You will see a corner with 1 more bolts. Climb broken rock up corner to a sloping ledge and calcite .3 cam corner. climb this 10 foot corner to huge ledge, walk right to anchor on ledge.    Pitch 5: Easy climbing, multiple options, some loose rock. Know that the final anchor is directly above you on a ledge. To get there go either left of right. Left was easy looking #5 OW, however we went right. Traverse right 30 feet and up easy calcite crack corner. Mantle up to huge ledge and go left a bit. Climb easy broken rock face style up to another ledge. Head left and go up short splitter crack for 15 more feet. The final anchor is to your left.    This climb was a great tower adventure! Mostly clean, some loose rock on top makes for a full tower experience! Did not look heavily trafficked but was only slightly sandy. Have Fun!",

The first pitch sports aesthetic, powerful climbing protected by a purple and gray TCU crack leading to a gently overhanging handcrack.

After you are about 15' off the ground, place your first decent piece, and gain the ledge up and right.  Plug in a couple of purple TCUs and head up using the arete on your left.  Follow the thin crack as it bends right and heads up again.  Continue to plug purple and gray TCUs.  About half way up, bust left through AWESOME face moves, gain the hand crack, and charge to the anchor. 40M 5.12   P2- Head up the ramp until you gain the wide crack with the huge flake sticking out.  Work over the flake to the off-width and continue up, doing whatever you need to to stay protected.  When the crack gets too wide for your gear, you'll pass a bolt.  Continue up to a one bolt anchor.  If you can, save a wide piece to double up at the anchor (if you can). This pitch was not done clean by the first ascentionists. 35M 5.11+   P3- Continue up the chimney, bust left at the roof, and gain the top of the climb. A cool bolted line awaits as an alternative last pitch up the huecos on the right. 20M 5.10   DECENT- Don't rap the route, remember the first pitch is 40M.  Instead, rap Choir Boyz. When at the top of the climb, scramble to the small \"summit\" on this side of the Convent (North end) Walk South (not far) til you are just past the highest point, and look for a cairn below a mushroom roof.  Just North of the cairn on a distinct ledge is a new and improved rap down Choir Boyz.

The moderate rating will probably seem like a total sandbag to those unaccustomed to disintegrating holds.   This climb is the free version of the aid route Renate Goes to Africa.  We (Goldstein, MacDonald) assume we did the first free ascent.  The name is a tip of the hat to Nigel Tufnel, who might say of the route, \"Don't even look at it\".   The salient feature of the route is a long, right leaning, black slab near the left end of the west face of the Convent;  this slab is clearly visible from the road.Start below the slab, at the base of a chimney blocked by large chockstones about 50' up.  Another identifying feature of the start is bolt about 30' above the ground.   P1: 5.10b, 60'.  Follow fisty crack on sandy rock past bolt and into chimney.  Chimney horizontally below blocks to lip and surmount (crux).  Pro is good, but even with long runners rope drag becomes untenable as soon as the chimney is escaped, forcing a premature belay just short of a comfortable alcove.  A one foot square piece of the key jug broke off as our leader was pulling the crux.  If the rock at the crux cleaned up, it would be a classic stretch of climbing.   P2: 5.8 50'.  Continue past the alcove and up the left crack system to a big ledge with lots of rubble.   P3: 5.7 190'.  From the right side of the ledge, up a left facing corner, passing a cluster of slings around a block about 20' up, until the slab is reached.  Up the slab, passing another, less developed anchor.  Belay at the end of the ramp, at a ledge to the right side of the start of a steep, off-putting chimney.  Be sure that the belayer is sheltered from rockfall.   P4: \"How Soon is Down\" 5.9, 80'.  Up the chimney with an occasional tricky offwidth move.  There is usually good wide pro where you want it; we backcleaned some to preserve these big pieces.  The crux is chimneying past a flake at the end of the pitch, just below a very intimidating overhanging offwidth.  We belayed in the chimney, at the base of this offwidth, though if you somehow have wide gear left, a much more comfortable belay is available by stepping out of the chimney onto a ledge.   P5: 5.10a, 100'.  Past the offwidth on excellent rock with good small pieces to easier climbing and the top.  Midway up this pitch, pass a \"rap\" anchor consisting of two severly tattered slings around a block so suspect that we didn't want to pull on it.   From the topout, you can see the rappel anchors at the top of Salvation Chimney, about 100' to the south.",

It doesn't get the traffic that a lot of the other Castle Valley trade routes get which has pros (no lines, more adventure) and cons (not quite as clean and user friendly).  If you've ticked off the other nearby towers, then you really have no excuse not to climb this route.  It has mostly straightforward meat and potatoes hand crack climbing with a few short but burly cruxes.  There are a few wide sections, too, but they're pretty clean and straightforward.   Heres how it breaks down:   P1 (150', 5.11+):  Traverse from the right into the corner below the huge roof.  Climb the corner  to the roof, get in some gear, and dip into your inner orangutan to bust out the roof.  The moves aren't obvious, but it's obvious that there are no feet and that if the hike up the talus didn't wake you up, this section of climbing will.  After the roof, battle the inevitable rope drag through fun hand cracks and a wide section protected by a #1 camalot crack in the back.  There are a few good ledges to set up a belay (save some hand-sized pieces).   P2(120', 5.11+):  Climb a super clean hand crack that starts at #1 camalots and goes to a #4 or #5 C4 before pinching back down to fingers and thin hands.  Where the crack gets wide, there are lots of pockets and face features to make things easier.  Pull a small roof via some really cool and fun moves (5.11+, but both my buddy Charlie and I thought it was WAY easier than the crux of P1).  Then keep climbing up a crack that eventually turns into a low-angled clean finger crack.  Belay in a recessed area.   P3 (~120', 5.8ish):  Continue up the crack system, which is basically a chimney at this point.  Work your way up through some ledges, and belay when it seems like it's just a scramble to the top.   Then scramble to the top.   Descent:  We rappelled the very large corner system located to the climber's left of the route (2 60m ropes required).  The first rap is from a single good, vertically-drilled bolt on a ledge located between the Value of Audacity and the very large corner.  The second rap has 1 good bolt and a bunch of junk.  The third rap has no good bolts and only junk (Someone needs to back this up.  A bolt would be great.  You might also be able to ditch a #10 hex in the crack here)   Note:  There are no fixed anchors on The Value of Audacity (and with a name like that, it seems like there shouldn't be)",

To find the first rap, scramble up and right from the top of last pitch and then walk left to a single (new) bolt anchor. We had two ropes, and ended up skipping some stations, but I don't think you could rap it with a single line (even a 70m). A few raps have old bolts and dicey pins, as well as crispy webbing. Bringing new tat and even a bolt kit (for the rap route, not VOA!) would be a great community service. -Scott Oct 28, 2010",

After a short distance up this even smaller wash break left to make for the ridge line taking care to avoid crypto. Once on the ridge line a faint trail will become evident. Follow the apex of the ridge all the way up to where you meet some cliff bands and the trail disappears. Go right up into the talus gully, and straight up the talus to the base, this bit kind of sucks, but its not too bad. Work your way near the base of choir boyz, obvious shallow left facing splitter corner. Rack up here and drop packs. Follow the base of the cliff over to the base of value of audacity. Work your way into the \"tunnel\" of a horizontal weakness that breaks left, crawl through and you will be at the base of the route.",

Holier than Thou climbs the beautiful, calcite-covered east face of the Nuns and is perhaps a welcome departure from the grunt fest of the nearby Honeymoon Chimney.   P1: 11 bolts to a two bolt belay.  Jay Smith did a fantastic job bolting this line.  The climbing is hard and in-your-face and the placements are spaced such that you are forced to do hard moves with bolts below you (you have to climb the route - you can't yard through it).  As you stretch and stretch for holds and clips, marvel at how Smith, at 5'6\", did it.  Around the third bolt the cruxes start coming - a hard mantle, a long reach to a tiny edge, another long reach to an undercling with terrible feet.  Higher up you step left onto a ramping feature and there's one more cruxy move here.  The pitch is 120' long and I felt that there was a lot of 5.11 climbing on it - fortunately there are one or two rests as well.  Also, be careful clipping the second bolt - definate groundfall potential here.   P2:  Identify two lines:  The original line goes up and left on black hangers at 5.10-, while a variation called \"The Unforgiven\" heads up and slightly right on silver hangers at 5.11c.  We took the former.  Clip four bolts (slightly runout but not as hard as the first pitch), then trend left around the corner, clipping an intermediate belay.  Belay here or use a long runner and climb up past a second intermediate belay (again with the option of belaying or continuing up), eventually stepping left into a crack system.  Climb up the short, excellent, left-curving crack at 5.10 (several hand-size pieces) to a final anchor on the summit.   Descent:  Two or three raps will get you down (a 70m rope or two ropes required).  I recommend leaving your second rope clipped to the anchor at the top of the first pitch and then doing a single rope rap from the summit to one of the intermediate anchors, then another single rope rap to the top of the first pitch, and finally a double rope rap to the ground.   A sensible way to climb the Nuns at a more moderate grade would be to link up The Flying Nun (10a) with P2 & 3 of Holier Than Thou (9+ & 10- respectively). At a higher standard, P1 of Holier Than Thou (11c) to The Unforgiven (11c) is the way to go.",

Second pitch is fun and easy.  Bring a few Aliens and some hand size pieces (mostly red C4) for the short third pitch.  The crack has an awkward arch but is very fun, and the last move will get your attention, bomber gear at your knees. Sep 13, 2011",

I certainly didn't see any 4th class climbing anywhere near the upper part of the first pitch and headed to the anchors I'd placed on The Flying. The Flying was originally climbed in 2 pitches (as was Holier Than Thou) to the summit, up the most natural line. How that is contrived is unknown to me.

If i were to do it again, I would deffinately link the first pitch of holier than thou to the unforgiven pitch, making for a clean straight shot up the center of the tower for almost a full 70 meter marathon on AMAZING calcite crimps, followed by a short tight hands to finger crack for the last 10 ft to the anchor. at the end of the unforgiven, it is sort of hard to see where the crack is, but traversing out right just feels amazing with all that air under you until you are finally rewarded by sinking your hand into the crack! as for the gear, if you were to link the 2 pitches, you might consider bringing 20-22 long draws/alpine slings(if you're linking the first 2 pitches), to keep rope drag at a minimum, especially long running the gear in the final crack(depending on how much you place) and a single set of cams .5-#3 is plenty for the summit pitch, if you're scared of tight hands cracks, maybe bring an extra #1 bd camalot.

The climbing is technical, fingery, and quite sustained.   One can rap from the summit in three raps with a single 70m rope - the final rap is rope-stretching.   Also, be aware that a lot of the rock is suspect on the Nuns - I fell twice ripping off holds on this pitch, and my partner fell once doing the same.  The climbing is really good in spite of this though... I swear.   P.S.  I climbed this again in 2007 and the pitch has either cleaned up a lot or my climbing has cleaned up a lot.  Probably the latter.  But in any case, I didn't rip a single hold off.  Oh, and anyone who claims calcite is slippery needs to sample this climb -- the best friction I've ever seen.",

This is for the equestrian trails. The climbing approach takes the immediate left after leaving 128 and there is a sign there indication climber access (although with no arrow). There is some initial roughness getting into the wash but it's mostly smooth with just a few tricky sections. Go 1.5 miles from 128 and look for the large (20+ foot boulder 100 yards off the road) and you'll most likely also spot the well worn trail down low on the hillside, below the large boudler. Find a wide spot in the wash and park well to the side. Mar 13, 2017",

We found no trail on the talus cone though there is apparently a trail to the 5th-class descent -- see below.  To gain access to the start of the route, stay high continuing about 200' left on the ledge with a TV antenna.   P1: The first pitch starts with a 5.9 layback boulder problem and quickly leads to a fun squeeze to wide chimney.  Protect using long slings on chockstones and a #2 cam near the top, 120' to belay pin.   P2: At this point we diverged from the original route -- moving directly to the back of the chimney (4th class) and 20' up a fun hand crack and onto a large chockstone, 100' 5.9. We think the original ascent continued up the chimney at the face for 60' to a chockstone/ledge.  The FA party must have then moved 50' into the tunnel without protection while 60' above the choss pile.  We followed a chossy tunnel that moves directly back into the cliff.  traversed into the back of this chimney from 60' up.  Our variation allows fun, protected climbing from the base of the chimney.  The original route allows you to either 1) grow your sack three sizes, or 2) die trying.   P3-P4: From the chockstone the business begins.  A 5.10 hand crack/ layback crack leads up about 30' until it possible to begin stemming.  Stem or layback another 150' in a bizarre setting to drilled warthogs at the top of the arch.  From the warthogs continue about 20' up slab, take a right and continue another 20' on a large ledge where a large flake leans against the wall (belay here).      We broke this 150' section into 2 pitches.  There is a crack that sucks up #1 Camalots at the back of the arch for the first 100'.  The second, 50' pitch takes yellow to green to blue Aliens.    P5: Stand on the balanced block and aid through 3 bolts to 5.7 (exfoliating) face climbing and the top (50').   We couldn't find the 5th-class descent; we think the description in Bjornstad is inaccurate.  Scope out the descent before climbing.  From the summit there appears to be 200' cliffs for the entire 'circumference' of the butte.  A better description of the location of the descent can be found in the comments below.",

It is a total pain in the ass, but it goes no problem. Here's how you do it: Keeping the South face of the mesa on your right walk towards Castleton (you can't see the tower but I'm guessing you know where it is). You'll see the large, cubic summit cairn with a register after about 5 or 10 minutes of walking. Sign the register. From there look back towards the top of AYM. \"Directly [east] across the mesa\" (as Steve said) you will see an obvious \"concave\" \"crescent\" shaped cliff (as Rob said). B-line it for the south edge of this crescent. When you get there walk north along the cliff until you see a tree with 3 cairns and a fixed static line. Yahtzee, you've found the descent. Descent down and right into and down a chimney with a bolt and a fixed rope. Then hug the cliff while descending down and right. At the right edge of the drainage do a small step over protected by a bolt (not needed) onto a ledge that brings you into the next drainage. Down climb a chimney with a fixed rope and traverse a ledge with a fixed rope/cable. Follow a trail down and right across the drainage (your sights should be set on sister superior). Eventually enough down-ing and right-ing will get you off the mesa. From here hug the base of the cliffs and traverse back to your packs or, if you were smart and didn't leave packs at the base, follow the trail back to the road. I uploaded a beta topo.

This is a full 35 M rope stretcher straight down. Then 20 M straight down the the floor of the chimney, it may be prudent to stay high in the chimney for a clean rope pull then downclimb to the next anchor (4th class but SUPER loose, give a belay).

We wasted a full day on route finding, because the main trail goes right, past the SE face, because it is heading to the Mountaineer's route. Look for a very inobvious trail going left right on the ridge between the SW and SE face, right after all the dirt \"fingers\", and before the trail turns right toward the SE face. This starts out as a traversing trail through the dirt, then boot tracks, then kind of fades into nothing. The first time, we tried to head straight up to the base to early and traverse, but a lot of hardpan required constant ascending and descending to traverse this way. It is much better to do a gradually ascending traverse to the left, and you can identify the weakness used to access these routes by the route in the guidebook called a fat crack called desire. It looks like a slightly grassy break in the cliff bands, and you follow that left, starting on the second ledge from the top, passing tv cables, and eventually getting to the highest ledge. Past the TV cables, it looks like it doesn't go, but keep going, it goes. The ledge is somewhat narrow, so keep looking up for a right facing dihedral going straight up. I had a belayer anchor, because those opening face moves are a little dicey off the narrow ledge. We reversed this in the dark, and it took way longer, but we were able to get it in 1:30 by daylight in the morning, after the failed attempt the earlier day. Crux pitch felt a lot more sustained at the grade than the crux of the W face of Castleton. I had to hang all over that even though I am a student of offwidth, it feels slightly overhanging, or at least dead vertical. Getting into the squeeze was very tough for me. I couldn't fit from the bottom, so had to chicken wing and arm bar around the roof to get high enough, I was so grateful I had a BD 7 to protect that. The crux into the #6 crack was tough because it narrows down and makes it very tough to sidewinder before I could get a double fist stack above. P2 felt really tough because the hand jams were kind of thin through the roof and feet were bad. I managed to get that part clean, but then there was a vertical #6 crack above that I hung in, though my partner did not, there are a lot more face features inside that crack. P3 first 30 feet felt pretty scary, I knocked down a huge rock and had it wedged in my leg, I had to release it, as my partner had me taken on good gear above. Then, another foothold broke off and broke my belayer's helmet. Thank God she didn't get hurt. I could barely chimney most of that, but I am tall, and I would guess it would be too wide for most. Didn't have time to do the bolt ladder as it was almost dark, definitely want to do that at some point. Anchors for rapping Ascended Yoga Master had seen better days, which is surprising given I saw a lot of ticks on that climb. It looked like on the first anchors, someone had rapped straight through soft gear, so that gear was no longer very trustworthy, and I left another cord and a screwlink. The next rappel involved rapping past a lot of loose. The final rappel anchor had a good bolt and pin, but no chains or tat. We left tat and a rap ring. Got to the ground, but then the rope got wrapped around a huge chockstone when pulling. Not sure this would have been avoidable. I led up Ascended yoga masters on the other side of the rope about 80 feet, cleared the snag, and downclimbed to a chock with fixed tat, left a biner, and rapped off of that, fortunately the rope pulled that time.

Of the 15-20 bolts on the ladder I think I redid like 8 or 9. I left the most interesting museum pieces but set it up so if they fail you would have a hard time zippering the whole thing. The top requires a body length of easy free climbing. The new summit anchor is just under the cap rock as the stones on t he summit are pretty weak and not actually connected to the tower. Most of the pieces I pulled were still difficult to get out. However one, a pin about 25 feet up, was essentially an aluminum RURP. It came out scary-easy. Oh, I spaced a couple of the pulls as I rapped off (we were running way-late). If you go up, please take a hammer and a funkness and yank those two that are next to new bolts. Sorry about that... A set of nuts is useful on the last pitch. My advice to anyone doing this is to NOT try and walk straight up the scree slop from the road. I ruined our day by doing this. Go up the draw a mile or so before finding a vegetated slope that comes up on the climber left as Tom said. Interesting route, unique setting, and wild summit.

                "route_description": "Super Natural is a great line offering a fine desert climbing experience with a little bit of adventure and plenty of good, clean cracks. Many options seem to exist on climbing this line and it seems like it could be done in 4 to 6 pitches, depending on your ability to run together some long pitches.Pitch 1 (5.8 or 5.10): The intended start is in the wide corner that starts up and left from the large detached block, or mini tower. The topo describes it as going at 5.8. We did not climb this option so can offer no more help. It looks easy enough but not as attractive as the option we took.Another pitch 1 option is to climb what is intended as the 1st pitch of Spirit World. It climbs the obvious crack in the shallow corner with a wide section before a small roof. Going at 5.10, it is harder than the original 5.8 start but it's a great pitch of climbing, offering just enough to make it go at 5.10. An extended section of #4 Camalot sized cracks warms you up for a little choss navigation before a wide section and an exciting move through the roof that is well protected. After pulling on to the ledge, you could set a belay or continue up on easier terrain. First a hand crack in a corner and then easy chimney climbing under some chock stones to a ledge with 2 bolts. This provides for ~190' pitch.Move the belay to the large corner system on the left via 2nd/3rd class easy scrambling. Here we were unclear of exactly where to go. It appears on the topo that you could perhaps go up to a chockstone and belay. We went into the chimney and belayed at the base of the corner system on a small pedestal of rock and this proved to be a fine way to do it, although it makes the 2nd pitch longer.Pitch 2 (5.10, 175'): An awesome, long pitch of climbing up the corner with a variety of sizes and plenty of face features to keep the difficulty down except for a section up high where you'll actually have to dig your mitts into the wide hands and fist calcite crack straight above. Don't traverse left into the corner with chockstones. That's really chossy. Belay at the Voodoo Ledge with small gear (.2-.4 Camalot size).Pitch 3 (5.8ish, 100'): Two options seem to exist. One is to go left from the belay and do what appears to be an exposed and probably unprotected step across to a wide crack. We opted for the straight up version which involved stemming and jamming directly above the anchor. Climb the corner system until you can move left across the calcite covered face. We moved left at the top of the corner. Belay on the rubble strewn ledge with #.3-.4 Camalots and/or #2-3 Camalots. [edit: your best bet is to climb straight up and traverse left about halfway up the dihedral, if you traverse at the top it's harder for both leader and follower]Pitch 4 (5.9+, ~175'): Go up the \"mud rock\" looking roof where good stemming and jamming is found and decent enough of rock quality (it is the desert after all!). Above the initial roof, a couple options seem to exist. I stayed left on some solid finger jams with good rock followed by some awesome face holds. Above, work your way into the wide chimney and grovel your way to the top. Belay takes #1 and #2 Camalots with ease.Go about 100' west to find the Voodoo Child top anchor and rappel that route. You can double rope rappel the first rap to Voodoo Ledge. If you're worried about the first pull you can rap twice to Voodoo Ledge on a single 60: rappelling first from the top of the mesa to the first anchor you find. Then, rappel from there to the Voodoo Ledge. Once on Voodoo Ledge do a full 200' rappel to the ledge at the top of the first pitch. Then, 175' to the ground.Other than the top anchor, which has cord on it, the rest are Metolius rap hangers and hence, are devoid of tat.",

The climbing approach takes the immediate left after leaving 128 and there is a sign there indication climber access (although with no arrow). There is some initial roughness getting into the wash but it's mostly smooth with just a few tricky sections. Go 1.5 miles from 128 and look for the large (20+ foot boulder 100 yards off the road) and you'll most likely also spot the well worn trail down low on the hillside, below the large boudler. Find a wide spot in the wash and park well to the side. Take the trail to the base of the wall and traverse right, under Crooked Arrow Spire and after rounding the corner on to the northwest side look for a tall flake with a couple of bolts on it and a large detached block at the base of the wall.",

Then we did a separate traversing pitch to the corner, tunneling by the larger boulder and setting up a belay on a shelf as described. Pitch 3:  the next pitch was confusing with several options. Here, the corner becomes a double corner with the \"calcite face\" in the middle section. The topo makes it look like you should stay to the left of the calcite face, and this is what we did, climbing a set of dihedrals and broken chimneys, ending up left of the \"step across\". Now I am sure that the previous ascents followed the crack to the right of the calcite face. Anyway, our path was also 5.10 but contained a lot of loose rock. Pitch 4:  having ended up on the left side of the corner, we followed the features arching up and right, and then back left to the large ledge. Pitch 5 was as described for the final pitch. Overall, I gave the route 2 stars because of the poor rock quality. The intended middle pitch is probably better rock than what we experienced, and I am sure the whole thing will clean up with more travel. Gear was generally adequate, where we made a lot of use of 3x #1-3, 2x #4, and #5. We had no trouble doing the first double-rope rappel and pulling the ropes. Apr 26, 2017",

At least they're well-protected. Despite what the topo shows, there should be no doubt about which way to go on the third pitch (pitch above the crux corner): Climb straight up the slot and left-facing corner above the belay, choose a 20-foot traverse line to the left to reach a crack, climb the crack to its top, then face climb left again to reach a big ledge. We chose to traverse about halfway up the upper corner, which was solid and fun and protected both leader and second reasonably well. Excellent pitch! Breaking the first rappel in two seems like the way to go. The first 25m rappel ends at a very nice ledge and bomber anchors, and it was nice not to have any worries about pulling the ropes. Note that the next anchor down (the second if you do two single-rope rappels from the top) is quite a long way to the left of the rappel line, so be prepared to shuffle along the narrow Voodoo Lounge ledge to reach it.

It amazingly links together several sections of great crack climbing with improbable face moves.  Definitely a little bit heads up, but the difficulties tend to back down or bolts tend to sprout up when you need them to.  The route has mostly good rock, a 180-foot pitch that takes 7 widely spaced yellow camalots in a row, and a steep bolted upper pitch with great sports action.   See topo added as beta photo.   P1. Climb up to the tombstone and slither behind it, clipping 3 bolts along the way. On ledgy ground above, traverse left a little further than you think you should and gain a thin hands/finger crack in a corner. Exit the crack to the right where it starts to get a bit wider, and a bolt appears. Thin face moves past the bolt get easier, but the rock gets softer, too. Wander up and right to a 2-bolt belay on a ledge next to a gully. 160', 5.10+/11-.   P2. Scramble up and left in the gully for about 30 feet, aiming for the flake system that starts as steep fingers/thin hands and turns into about 1 mile of hands. Clip a bolt past a wide section/flake, and eventually cut right below a roof to gain another ledge with 2 bolts. Save a few thin hands/fingers size pieces for the last 30 feet. 180', 5.11.   P3. Climb the striking finger crack until it ends about 20 feet above the belay. Continue up blocky terrain to a spot where the wall kind of blanks out. Stuff some cams in a horizontal, and leave it all behind by climbing up and left on face holds. Like George Michael said in 1986, \"You gotta have faith-a-faith-a-faith!\" Once the difficulties back off, wander up and right to another 2-bolt belay on a ledge. 60', 5.11.   P4. Climb up the bolted shallow corner system just right of the anchor. Feels steep for the desert, and requires a bit of body English, too. Skootch left in a strange horizontal feature between a closely spaced ledge and roof with some loose rock between. After this, climb up through a weakness to another ledge. You could probably climb straight up for about 25 feet to the top from here, but the rock is pretty loose and the pro not so great.

Kudos to Jay Smith's  prolific efforts with his partners for adding another desert classic!!

So after ecountering that, I moved down at the last bolt,  and  did a hand traverse right ,  then went  to the top with no pro and flipped the rope over so second could come up via the coffin traverse. Jay later told me he had tried removing the very loose looking pinched block you would use and could not get it to come out. However even the ledge for your feet looked suspect. We didn't try and clean and knock anything off on rappel for fear of hitting the ropes and it was getting late in the day. On the second pitch you need to really watch the rope drag. Being a very long pitch with the crux at the top. it doesn't take much for it to become a big issue. Best to reach back and clean any pro under the left arching roof that you climb at the bottom before getting into the hand crack.

Stiff start, and then eases up into seemingly endless perfect hands that get progressively steeper. Didn't find the #4 useful here (by the time you can place it you're at the bolt), you can probably use it on P1, we didn't. I placed 6 generously spaced #2s, four before the bolt and two after. Save a purple, green and red camalot (and some long slings) for the last 10-15m, its the hard part. On that note, you don't want to be cruxing out with heinous rope drag, so extend things and plan accordingly. P3: Hardest moves are right off the anchor above a ledge, but takes great pro here. Gets headier and runout above, but much easier. Fun mix of face and crack climbing. P4: Wasn't sure what to expect from this one, but it was awesome. Climbs like a (well bolted) sport route until you hit the traverse, at which point it eases off, and gets super awkward. After the traverse I went straight up to the top- you get a short, fun section of fingers, and a potentially heartbreaking final roof-pull. Plenty of ways to traverse off left or right and make it super easy, and then come back over to the anchor. TLDR; gem of a climb, go get on it! Nov 2, 2021",

                "route_description": "This is the spectacular bolted route on the North Face of The Priest.  It climbs unique calcite features similar to those on Holier Than Thou on The Nuns.     Greg Child apparently bolted this route in September, 2002.  He established the route \"ground-up\"\u2014which I think is a bit misleading, because he basically made a bolt ladder out of it. True, it was ground up, but it was not free, nor was it bold.  There are several holes in the rock with missing bolts, so apparently he (or maybe someone else) decided to take bolts out after the fact.   Mr. Child apparently worked on freeing it for a long time.  A magazine article in Rock and Ice from early '03, which has pictures of the route but makes no mention of the route in the article, describes the line as a \"project.\" Rumor has it that Mr. Child hiked up there 64 times(!!) to work on it...that sounds a little unbelievable to me. The summit register mentions the first (aid) ascent, but the register doesn't record when it was freed.     The April 2005 issue of Rock and Ice lists the route as a \"new route\" in the Moab area, rating the 5 pitches as 12b, 12a, 13a, 11c, and 10c, but calling the overall route \"13b\". It also claims the route was thus-far unrepeated, despite attempts from two \"strong teams.\"  I wonder who those teams are.  Rumor has it, Eric Decaria checked it out, but decided not to work the route because he didn't like all the glue on it.   Here's what I thought:   In April '05, Clay Cahoon and I made an ascent, which we guess is the 2nd, but who knows?  It took us 3 total days of effort. On the final day we each freed every pitch starting from the ground, and we both redpointed the crux pitch.   P1: 5.12b (9 bolts, 90 feet) First of all, I would say that this pitch (and the next one) is all of 12b.  It's not like the easy 12's at Indian Creek; I would say it's on a par with Sacred Ground on Castleton Tower, which is pretty stout.   The pitch climbs the bolted arete, using actual arete moves.  The arete keeps your attention due to its sharp nature, and the fact that it seems like it is always windy right there. A couple hard, thin moves get things started, then it eases a bit above a horizontal crack.   The crux comes higher with a hard clip and balance-y arete moves.  There are 9 bolts, a drilled angle, and no glue on this pitch.   P2: 5.12a (6 bolts, gear, 70 feet) This pitch is a bit easier, but a lot scarier.  Your rope actually has to cross the arete on this pitch, so the thought of falling is terrifying. You're still climbing on the arete, but now things are starting to get exposed.   The first bolt is on the left side of the arete, then all the rest are on the right, even though you mostly climb on the left side.  About 40 feet up, the holds on the arete peter out, but fortunately, a dihedral crack appears on the right.  The crux involves getting from the arete into the crack.  I broke a hold on this section, but another good hold appeared underneath it, so the pitch still goes.   Once in the crack, some sharp calcite jams lead to the fat ledge at the base of the crux pitch.  There are five or six bolts on this pitch, and you'll want a small cam (0.2 camalot), but you can get by with one 0.5.   P3: 5.13a (9 bolts, 90 feet) This is the money pitch.  Fortunately this pitch climbs up the center of the face on calcite, so it's not quite as scary or windy.   A few easy arete moves past two bolts get you firmly established on the face. The climbing is very reminscent of just-past-vertical limestone, such as that found at the VRG. The climbing gets increasingly harder until a series of crux deadpoints, or tenuous reaches near the 6th bolt.   After a good rest at a horizontal crack (lots of glue that seems unnecessary), a couple more very hard moves with heart-break potential stand between you and the next cush ledge (about 9 bolts...90 feet).   P4: 5.11c (4 bolts, 40 feet) This short pitch contains an interesting combination of wingate and calcite features before the holds dead end at a less-than-vertical slab which forms the crux.   Clay and I both climbed this differently, and we had different opinions on the accuracy of the grade.  If you made it this far, it should be no problemo. Belay on the shoulder of The Priest.     P5: 5.10+ R (2 bolts, gear .75-2, 40 feet) The summit pitch.  It would be possible to link 4 and 5, but the rope drag could be really scary.   Start up a nice crack that is formed by a car-sized flake leaning against the wall.  When you gain the top of the flake, you get to stem up a rotten corner.  Thankfully, Mr. Child left two bolts here to reduce the pucker factor.  The rock is bad, and you're smearing on it...yeehaw.     All in all, both Clay and I thought this was an outstanding route.  It is entirely unique. The climbing consisted of good movement, spectacular position, and mostly excellent rock. To top it off, all of the pitches have great ledges which make it more enjoyable to work the route. I have no doubt this route will get harder with time as key holds snap off and calcite footholds get even more polished.     As for the glue...I don't feel that this route is \"manufactured\" because it's not like key holds have been glued on where none existed before. In many cases the glue is there to reinforce large features that offer good rests. These holds are not critical to allowing the route to be free climbed; if the glued holds did break off the route would still go, it just might be more pumpy.   This may cause you to wonder, well why glue these holds at all?  Good question. Perhaps he thought it was a matter of safety, as many of these rocks are large enough to kill someone if they did peel.   All in all, I highly recommend this route, and I tip my hat to Mr. Child...well done!",

The route was established on or about mid-August 2002.  Greg Child freed the route on or about August 23rd, according to my recollection.  You will have to believe me because I was the belayer, Jay Smith was also with us, and Simon Carter filmed us all.  Greg and I, started the route on or about early July....hiking up...scoping it out, then, one, two three pitches by the end of July.  Then, the route became more difficult.  We proceeded to establish the route, (I belayed and Greg climbed...just he and I); about 21 days into it, he successfully freed it with Simon Carter (filming) and Jay Smith who also helped him a few days here and there, whereas I needed a break!  So, I actually can calculate about 23 days for the routes' completion, on my end.  I will always remember the day he freed it! Simon Carter was filiming, (Greg had already freed the most difficult pitch with Jay Smith a day or so earlier, and this was just to finalize the route.)  As we started the climb, let's just say August 23rd, 2002; Greg was almost to the first anchor with a good size ledge, but not much for protection.  A classic run out by old school climbers.  A rattlesnake was staring at me in the face at eye level with his teeth about to bite my neck.  I screamed bloody murder and dished out rope to Greg and ran away from the spire.  Greg, knew instantly that something was wrong.  I kept giving him rope, he arrived at the first anchor; and we communicated that he is coming back down to deal with the snake.  He came down and picked up the snake with a stick and tossed him away into the desert.  We started again.  Well, that damn snake arrived right back and planted himself in the middle of all out gear and backpacks and was not about to budge.  Greg came down, again!  This time he got the snake with his hands and went waaaay further away, and told me how they are super territorial.  Third time is a charm, and he, Jay Smith and I, all proceeded to climb the route.  Greg nailed it.  As we approached the last pitch, (we had not established it, yet), Greg offered the final pitch to me, and Jay agreed.  I was so frickin' excited.  I put in two (2) bolts, hanging on solid hooks with our bosch drill.  As Greg and Jay got to the top, they both said I did an impressive job!  I was so excited...what a great climb and great job by all!  Then, all the sudden...these airforce jet planes that come out of Grand Junction peeled by us, as we were all celebrating.  They did a pass by, twice!  It was exhilarating!  As you may know, Jay Smith is an ex-Navy Seal!  I wondered, if he had something to do with it, but he said no...just luck or timing!  Anyway, we wrote in the journal and headed; mission accomplished.  Just a side note...we saw five (5) rattlesnakes that day from top to bottom!   The experienced showed me Greg's true valuable colors of determination and ethics.  I have no comment about any 'glue' considerations to the route.  My opinion is that, if it will save a life while challenging yourself on an insurmountable climb, then its okay by me!  Set the record straight.  You can always verify this with Simon Carter or Jay Smith, or Greg, of course!  Thanks for the recognition of the route!  It is amazing and I hope that many more continue to challenge and enjoy its spice of life!  Peace out, Renee Globis Dec 26, 2020",

For P2, I second Brent's comment about back-cleaning draw 2 after 3 is clipped. This was trivial to do and allowed the rope to run nicely around the arete. There was a draw left on bolt 2, presumably for this reason. If this is to remain fixed, it should be upgraded. The calcite on P3 is very different from the waxy, white calcite of Indian Creek. Instead, it's much more reminiscent of tufa climbing. I found this pitch to have some of the most unique and enjoyable climbing around! On P3, I'd recommend clipping bolt 5 with an alpine draw or using 3 total quickdraws of extension so that it can be clipped while your foot is still on the large, glued jug. A long stiffy draw might be useful for hanging this on lead. P3 had 2 distinct crux sections. The first is on razor-thin crimps. Bring plenty of skin. The second is on tufa-like rock with weird holds and technical footwork. Edging shoes were appreciated. Finally, this route is commonly used as the rappel route for the other routes on the Priest. Some of the anchor bolts have a quicklink with a single chain link on the end, rather than a rappel ring. Upgrading to rappel rings would be trivial and prolong the life of these stations. I'll try and replace these when I return. Let us know if you get to it before I do. Oct 26, 2022",

Here, you can bury a nice granite sample in the rope at the bottom of your partner's pack, which can be hauled up to the base of The Priest the following weekend.   P1: This is the most serious and rewarding pitch on the route. Squirm your way up the fatter-than-fat dihedral. The amount of squeezing you can do is inversely proportional to your size. The crux has a 1/4\" bolt nearby, which in even Wingate sandstone, should inspire confidence\u2014right?   Find your own way through the crux, after which you can get a rest on a small ledge and clip drilled angle that will be in the back of your mind for the next thirty or forty feet of 5.9.  After this, you will occasionally get pro by slinging chock stones in the crack and/or placing stoppers between them.   As you near the end of this pitch, you will be able to chimney inside the crack. Belay just behind a large boulder wedged in the chimney.  You can build an anchor by threading a large stopper in between the boulder and the chimney and sticking a #3 Camalot near your feet.   Don't belay at the rap anchors 20' behind you or you will have hell to pay for rope drag.  After grunting up this pitch, I was rewarded with the following high-pitched whines from my second that made it all worthwhile: \"I hate this! This sucks! I can't get in the crack!  Take!!!\" If I could have recorded all this...  Maybe add a camcorder to the gear list. 5.9, really...   P2: This is the most fun pitch on the route. You'll see. I think it went around 5.7.   You basically chimney the whole thing. There is a fixed pin on this pitch.  Towards the top, you can get a couple of cams. It ends on a nice ledge with two of those nice and fat Metolius rap anchors.   P3: This pitch is either about 5.7 A0 or 5.11-.   Head up and right from the belay. There are some fixed pro and cam placements as you do the first part of this pitch. You get a nice body stem to access the arete/face that takes you upward toward the summit.   The face/arete (11- or A0) is basically a bolt ladder where some bolts are relics and others are decent-looking. This accesses a ledge, which you traverse to the left before gaining the belay. You are totally uncool to your second if you don't put a #2 Camalot in the crack at the back of this ledge after doing the bolt ladder.   P4: This is a relatively short dihedral crack system that goes at 5.8.  This nice little pitch puts you on the summit.   Summit - while on the summit, read the summit register notebook COVER to COVER and be sure to view the creative artwork within its bindings.  You will thank me.",

Use this as the belay anchor for the first pitch as the climb starts on a large ledge, and leave it there.   All you really need is several long runners, cams from around a #2 TCU to a #3 Camalot, and some stoppers.",

The rest of the rack would be fine with a set of camalots from #3 down, with doubles in 1, .75, .5 and .4, and a handful of medium stoppers.  A couple small cams could ease mental problems, but would they hold? The third pitch eats up slings, not only for the bolt ladder, but also because the pitch wanders left, up and then back right.  You really need a sling per piece, and then a couple extra for aiding the bolt ladder if you can't climb 5.11 face in the desert and are under 6 feet tall.  We had 9 slings, and would have been happier with 12. For rapping, you almost need two ropes (50 or 60M are fine).  The first rap would be a scary ordeal with one rope-it may or may not barely reach.  Two ropes are mandatory from the top of pitch one to the ground. Cheers, Frank May 1, 2002",

You CAN NOT get off of the summit via the standard raps with a single 60M rope. It would be a very unpleasant downclimb from the ends to the anchors as well. A single 70M barely gets you to the next reasonable belay, at the top of the 2nd pitch. From the top of the first belay, a 70M hits the ground if you are willing to rap off of the end of your rope 5' to the ground. We took the 70M up and tested that and succeeded. I grabbed the rope above the belay device, rapped off of the unknotted ends and swung over a few feet uphill to a 2-foot drop to a flat boulder. When my partner came down, she tied a knot in one end so that we wouldn't \"loose\" the rope. I grabbed her by the feet and swung her over to a similar drop. A 60M would be no good. 2*50M would work fine too, and you'd have less rope piled at the belays than with 2 60M ropes. Take a 70M or twin 50M. Second:  Pro. I wanted more, but it wasn't going to happen. I took up a set and a half of cams up to a #5 Camalot. Try as I might have, the #5, #4.5, and both #4s were useless at best, and at worst, weighed me down and caught up in the chimney between by butt and the wall. I looked for a place to put them, but really they added nothing to the climb. I was suspicious that the other climbers here dissing the OW pro were just being 'tough guys.' Not so... After having done this I seriously recommend the following rack: a load of slings, 1 full set of nuts, a few small tricams (pink, red) a full set of cams from .3\" to a 3.5\" (#3-#3.5 Camalot).  The #3.5 is only for backing up the shitty 3rd belay if you wanted to load it up, but a 1-1.5\" cam, a #3 Camalot and a stopper could work too. Taking a second set of TCUs might help in a few places, but not much. You may consider doing a community service of taking up loads of webbing and a knife to replace the tattered and aging slings on the otherwise good chockstones found in the wide first pitch. Third:  Wind and the raps down. This climb is in a chimney system and then up an arete that funnel wind amazingly well. While the wind on 5/3/03 was a mere 40+ MPH, certain spots on the climb were so windy that our clothes flapped like flags in a storm, our helmets were nearly peeling off and it was at times impossible to open our eyes. Even shouting, we could not hear each other once more than 30' apart. Luckily this was on the way down, but unluckily the wind was so strong that while pulling our ropes from the summit, the wind whipped it dead horizontal and then around a corner and back over the summit. I had to take what rope we had left and start leading \"micro-pitches\" up the rock to gain rope and make each pitch larger- first to the big step across move (belayed off of the 2 old pins + 2 cam in a horizontal) then to belay #3, then to the top. The wind was nearly peeling me off of the rock and several times literally blew me around the 3rd pitch arete. Rapping again, I clipped both ropes above the climber to a sling on the manky traverse bolt so they didn't get whipped that high again until the rope was mostly pulled. On the bright side, I got on the summit twice... The first pitch was fun if you like that sort of thing. My partner hated it. I thought it was OK. This is like the admission price, not the goal. The second pitch was more fun- kind of a wild chimney. The 3rd pitch and famous step-across didn't seem like they'd be that hard without gale-force winds. They are not the dreaded sandy sloper holds, but sharp, hard calcite edges and some good flakes. I was dreading the idea of a 5.11a slope-fest on the arete, but that's not what it is. I didn't free the pitch (I didn't try at first) but did do quite a bit of it and thought is was not so bad. Getting slammed into the rock by wind, I was still able to hold on to most of it. The webbing on the chocks in the first pitch is on its way to grim, although it is still so-so, I'd wager that most of it is of much-reduced strength. The 3rd belay is atrocious and needs a solid pro backup. Replacing the webbing on this would be a service, but the wind stopped me from reaching it at all on the way down. May 5, 2003",

I also agree that a single set of Camalots is all you need for the rest of the climb. I brought doubles and did not use them. Use a #3 to back up the 3rd belay. 2 double 60m raps drop you to the start. Awesome climb. Sep 29, 2003",

I think one big bro is probably adequate, depending on how much you trust the tat on the chockstones in the chimney (or are willing to replace the tat).  As for where to place the big bro, I would either place it between the bolt and the drilled pin or 10-15 feet after the drilled pin.  Once you are fully in the chimney, you are not really at risk of a big fall and you can use the chockstones for pro. Before you fully enter the chimney, there is a small crack in a hold on the left face where other commenters have mentioned placing small stoppers or lowe balls.  I placed a red lowe ball in this crack and (perhaps this is my own ineptness at placing lowe balls), but it popped out right after I climbed past it.  Anyway, it did not seem very secure to me.

From here the difficulties end and it\u2019s 10 more feet of crisp liebacking with good feet to another small ledge and rest where you can place a nut or cam or sling the chockstone. You can squeeze inside here and while slung chockstones are available, they are unnecessary as you aren\u2019t going anywhere. The business is between the two fixed pieces. Not after. Way less serious than I expected. Two large nuts were nice for the belay. If you want to link into pitch 2, don\u2019t clip any gear in the chimney. I found the belay here comfy and sunny. No reason to not stop. Pitch 2- fun chimney. Look up and right 20 feet from the belay for the drilled piton, then I got a nice small nut in towards the arete, then a worthless star drive. It\u2019s all you get and all you need. Great feet. Pitch 3- you\u2019ll see at least 3 relics on this pitch. I found a .3 camalot was nice to have for the final finger crack before the belay. Two .4s or a .5/.4 combo is ideal for the gear belay. A single rusted,protruding star drive is your other option. Pitch 4- fun crack. Placed 3 cams, .5,1,.3. Gear: nuts, 2 .3s/.4s and singles to 1 camalot. Tons of qds, like 10. Not sure why so many others don\u2019t recommend bringing cams smaller than .5 as they were critical for me Apr 14, 2018",

Kneepads are nice to have on this pitch, maybe even for P2. For the laziest and most comfortable anchor atop P1, go behind the highest set of chockstones, clip to a sling that you thread around the pinch, and sit down/stand there. The rope is easy to handle from there. For P2, chimney up and right to reach the first piton (facing south, or with your back on the main tower). Continue up and right near the edge of the chimney to a lousy #2 Camalot placement or a better #0.4 placement (if using a C3). Follow the edge back up and left past a bolt before reaching more trad gear opportunities near the top. For P3, some bolts are very far apart, so if aiding you will either need to top step in your aiders, assisted by sidepulling the arete, or bring a short stick clip. The final bolt is still far below the ledge, so you either need to do an awkward free mantle move, or bring a hook. Place a #2 right behind this to protect the second and allow them to gracefully follow if they are aiding on TR. P4 is very fun, straightforward, and well-protected (place/bump your first cam high for the second). The climb around the edge is cl. 3, although exposed.

I highly suggest linking p1 and p2 so you end up on the ledge and belay off the Metolius rap hangers.  Knee pads made this pitch much more enjoyable.  The rope drag is non-existent if you refrain from clipping the chockstones further back up the chimney, opting instead to run it out to the stellar bolt.  I placed a .3 upside down in a small crack near the edge of the chimney; a totem or c3 might have been able to be placed with a downward pull instead.  There's a .4 crack just 3' higher, for what it's worth. We also linked p3+p4.  It would have been nice to have another set of finger cams for this bit and avoid clipping the janky homemade hardware.  If you don't place the #2 for your follower after the bolt ladder, you're a sadist. 2024 update: bring a #7 Rack used: single .3-3, Merlin 8, 10 alpines, 1 double length Suggested rack: 0.3-0.5 (2), 0.75-2, 7 (1), alpines (10), double length (1) Aug 12, 2019",

We were one of 4 parties climbing the route, and talking with the others, we had consensus on the below points. A combined French-Canadian-Czech team rigged the described line Nov 17 and kept it up for three days. Good for them, however: They chose to put there camp on top of the rectory, just above the ultra-classic, ultra-crowded route Fine Jade. I don't know the legality of this and I don't really care, but there a few things anyone fixing up to the rectory should consider: 1. Do not haul on Fine Jade, and do not haul in the path of climbers. My partner was nearly knocked off the crux splitter finger crack on pitch two by a haul bag. The hauling team continued to haul despite our best attempts to get them to stop, and bumped the leaders gear, the leader, and eventually even dropped the bag to avoid it hanging up on the ledge to climbers right of the crux, where it conveniently landed directly on me at the top of the pitch one belay. Luckily it only had trash in it. This seems pretty unacceptable. Additionally, this team was hauling from the step below the 5.11 sport finish, with ropes to the final bolted anchor above. This caused a total cluster of ropes and made finishing this pitch very complicated. 2. Do not fix ropes to the Fine Jade belays while people are climbing. Same as above, multiple people aiding through leaders ropes and into belay stations, necessitating people switching around and coming on and off of their anchors. This was heinous, as at two separate belays i had to deal with my partner leading while someone tried to pass me to the next section of fixed line. Not cool and potentially dangerous. This also makes building a climbing anchor more complicated. 3. There was a massive camp atop the Rectory, right over the lip. Maybe 20 people? They had firewood, tents, coolers, etc. I think camping up here would be very cool too. However, the team was very casual about their trash. I don't believe they knew (perhaps because they were international and not many spoke english) that they cannot discard banana peels, avocado skins, paper tea bags, random other \"biodegradable\" trash items on the ground in this area. I brought it up to the two people I could find who spoke english. The canadian man gave me a non-commital \"They'll deal with it\" or something like that, but the American woman with them was a local and seemed surpised that they had done this, promising to make sure they left the area clean. Hopefully that happened. 4. This one is a little insane, but at one point they began furiously constructing 6 foot streamers of orange tape and spacing them along the line. I guess they feared a plane would pass between the towers and be destroyed? They assured me they had the correct permits, but I don't know that they did, or if permits are required for this sort of thing, but this is a consideration. 5. A \"drone Pilot\" approached me in the parking lot asking if i had seem his lost drone. Though we weren't buzzed by drones while climbing, i don't doubt that they were around and maybe others werent so lucky. Please remember that some people may only get to climb one of these routes once, and a drone constantly swooping around could seriously kill some of the stoke. 6. If you are going to do all of this anyways and ruin someones day, DO allow people to rappel your fixed line. The party hesitated on allowing us to rap the line, but finally someone kind of took charge and allowed us to descend on it. If you're going to get in the way, at least let people use your fixed line to get out of your huge cluster. Nov 27, 2018",

It's a bit harder than it's classic neighbor, Fine Jade, but in my opinion, it's just as good.  It gets afternoon shade.   P1.  Start in a finger crack in a shallow L facing corner, traverse left at a ledge with a bolt, and continue up a finger crack in a R facing corner that becomes a groove.  Exit the groove via a tricky bulge (WAY harder than it looks from the ground, and the crux of the route - IMHO)and clip the anchor bolts. ~80', 5.11+   P2.  Traverse L ~10' with cool face moves to gain a thin but gradually widening crack.  Continue up the finger to hands crack to a ledge with anchors.  The crux is pulling through a bulging groove with a hand crack in the back.  ~100', 5.11.   P3.  More fingers and thin hands with pumpy bulges but also so decent rests.  The crux for me was a dastardly high step on sandy rock a mere foot or two below the anchors.  This pitch ain't over 'til it's over. ~100', 5.11   P4.  Traverse left 10-15' on thin but positive face holds to a seam that eventually turns into a finger crack.  Indeed, the face climbing appears improbable at first, but all comes together to make for some thought-provoking climbing.  Make sure to have a few small to medium stoppers and long runners to protect this section.

A few notes and beta: - All bolts and hardware on the route is good, but the tat is starting to wear at the anchors.  Chains would be a good contribution. - The route can easily be rappelled with a 70m rope, and is a good alternative if Fine Jade is crowded to rap down. - 0.5 and 0.75's seemed to be the main sizes and having 4 of each felt comfortable.  More could be used if this is a crux size.  If wanting to bring more gear, add on the finger sizes, not many places for #2's and #3's where it is difficult.  We found a #4 completely optional, and next time I wouldn't bring a #4. - The Pitch 4 traverse is spicy for both the leader and the follower.  While not unsafe, it would be an exciting ride if either blew the difficult, sandy, face-climbing moves, which I thought warranted an 11+/12- rating.  With this logic, I'd wholly say PG-13 is fair for this section.  The rest of the route protects well. - The higher you go on the route, the worse the rock quality gets, and I found the top of P3 and most of P4 to be rather sub-par as far as classic desert towers go.  Excellent adventure nonetheless, just can't put it on the same league as the other 4-star routes I mentioned above! - Fully agree with moving the Pitch 1 anchors slightly to the left.  Currently, the top of P1 and top of P3 are hanging stances. - This is a great warm-weather outing, since the sun leaves the route and goes into the shade around 11am/12pm in October, making for excellent shady temps.

With the current belay locations, it makes a lot of sense to lead this route in blocks so no one ends up at a hanging belay for an extended period of time.  One person gets the first two pitches to the comfy ledge, then the other person takes the last two to the top.  Lastly, the tat is in really bad shape.  It'd be great if someone wanted to add chain or at least quicklinks to each of the three anchors.  If I go out again soon I will, but thought I'd mention it here in case someone is looking to do a little community service. Apr 3, 2021",

To reach, hike up the trail to the base of Castleton and then traverse North on the ridge for a couple hundred yards to reach the base of the rectory. The route climbs the crack system on the Southern prow of the rectory facing Castleton Tower.P1- Climb a fist crack past a pod and make a difficult thin hands move right. Climb up to a ledge with anchors, pass them and continue thin hands to fingers to a ledge with bolts and belay. (5.10+)P2- Continue up the crack to a finger crack through a bulge. Past the bulge climb a hand crack past a small roof to a belay stance. (5.11a)P3- Make some lieback moves, then pass a short rotten section to a roof. Continue up the crack to a big ledge and belay or continue up the 5.11 bolted face to the top. If climbing the original route, traverse directly left from the big ledge below the top for 25-30 feet or so and top out a steep crack in a corner.Descent- 3 double rope rappels down the route or 5 single rope rappels with a 70M",

I also found the last pitch to be honest 5.11 sport, but in a tricky way, not a pumpy way.  I'm tall and found it a little reachy, but my partner found a totally different way to do it so maybe I just didn't look hard enough.  I'll try the original finish next time. Don't forget to bring enough small stuff.  I would bring two or three of both blue and yellow TCU-sized cams for the thin crack parts.  Also, don't worry about starting up the route with another party above you, as there is an entire second set of rap stations that will allow parties to pass one another easily.  I recommend two 60s as the pitches are all longer than 100 feet.  All the anchors on the route are fantastic, as is the rock quality.

Then to the higher of the two p1 anchors. Then down to the top of the 5.2 starting block, then down solo the block. This just barely reaches the ground on the starting block rap. This rap beta seems similar to someone else\u2019s beta for rapping on an 80, so maybe my 70 is just really long, probably want to be careful and knot your ropes if trying this. There are no bolted anchors on the big ledge where the 5.11 sport pitch starts, but you can sling one of the two huge boulders for an anchor, or belay a little lower at a bolt anchor.  The 5.11 sport pitch seemed like low 5.11 sport climbing, 3 bolts in maybe 40 feet. The bolt spacing felt a bit spicy given the potentially of a fall before bolt 1 taking you off the edge, and falls near bolt two maybe putting you back on the ledge. Also seemed like the moves are a bit height dependent. Im 5\u201910\u201d, might be a bit harder if your shorter to make the move near the second bolt. Nov 16, 2024",

Every pitch is worthy in its own right.  The 1st two pitches have rap anchors.   The route starts in front of opposed layback corners which are about 15' apart, underneath the huge pillar that leans against the west face, about 50 yards left of Fine Jade.   P1. 5.10c 120'.  Start in the right corner.  Climb thin finger laybacking for 30' to a ledge, then continue in the same crack system, now a right facing corner w/ mostly thin hands to a bolted anchor at a ledge.  A two star Indian Creek pitch.Variation: \"old fashioned\" 11a tips laybacking.  The left crack/corner at the start is much more classic (and harder) than the one described above.  This variation required a couple of extra green Alien sized cams.  Traverse to the regular line on the ledge at 30'.  Careful rope management is required to avoid rope drag on the upper part of the pitch -- we added a belay at the end of the traverse.  Another problem with this variation is the \"not cranking on all cylinders syndrome\" -- the first move of the route and probably the day, is the hardest.   P2.  5.11a 120'.  Continue up the crack system, starting with 15' of 5.9ish chimney which will seem harder if you don't have a 5 Camalot sized piece.  A long stretch of steep, beautiful hands and fingers gets you to a hole with a cruxy technical reach to a chossy ledge. 20' feet of easy hands brings you to a lackluster stance and another bolted anchor.  Once the ledge at the end of the crux cleans up, this is a three star Indian Creek pitch.   P3. 5.10c 90'.  Staying in the crack system follow easy hands  to a suprisingly hard pull onto a ledge.  Above the ledge the crack seams out for about 10' resulting in good ,hard and reachy moves protected by wires.  After this, the crack widens to hands and cups through a flare (The Burnisher).  Belay about 20' below the roof unless you have excellent rope drag management skills in which case you should link the next pitch.   P4. 5.9 50'.  Up the crack to the roof utilizing juggy blocks where you dare.  Hand traverse the side of the roof and continue up a a stembox to an OK stance about 20' below the rim.  Disregarding the choss, this pitch is somewhat Gunks-like.  If you didn't link this pitch w/ P3, it can easily be linked with P5 if you use enough long runners below the roof.   P5. 5.11a (soft) 20'. Stem and layback out the left side of the stem box on remarkably sticky calcite.  A few feet of easy hands leads to another instantaneous Rectory topout.  The hard part can be protected with either micro cams or a #4 Camalot.   Descend Fine Jade.",

In March of 2018, Madeleine Sorkin and I rehearsed the two variants to pitch two and climbed to the top. I returned a week later and finished equipping the route.  Josh Wharton and I made a free ascent a week after that. After leading the 5.11 variant of the second pitch to the anchors, Josh lowered to the no hands rest and pulled the rope. Climbing directly up the corner, he fell going for the finishing bucket when he broke a hold. I climbed the last pitch and Josh cleanly top-roped the corner on the way down. The anchors at the top of the first and second pitches are notably robust. I discovered the hard way that the expansion sleeves on 4\u201d bolts may not engage in very soft rock and that it can take multiple holes to get a bomber bolt. After discussing the situation with two experienced locals, I opted for a belt and suspenders approach. I left the good bolts in place and filled the extra holes with reassuringly snug 2 \u00be \u201d bolts to create four-bolt, chain-equalized anchors. Intense wind on the day Josh and I sent the route foiled my attempts to camouflage the prominent chains.  A six-pack of the beer of your choice awaits the first party to apply a judicious bit of camo paint to them. Josh thinks that Absolution will merit 3 stars once it receives some more traffic. For now, we'll call it two stars until it gets broken in. It is adequately protected, user-friendly, and goes pretty quickly. Those competent at the grade will find it an attractive complement to a day on Jah Man.

If you go the wrong way it's worth it to turn around as the scree is very loose in many places (in search of a shortcut I jumped to a desk-sized rock which began sliding down the steep slopes and over a cliff band - I jumped off just in time and only by spread eagling on the ground could I stop from sliding down with it).  I recommend going around the far (east) side of Sister Superior for as long as possible.   Without the photo in Bjornstad's guide I would have never found this rock, but once you see it you can't miss it - there is a hole in the middle where the two blocks rest against each other and it really does look like it's going to fall over.

                "route_description": "This is a good route with some good stone and good moves.  The position is improbable once up high and the presence of a few good holds in key places is what makes this thing possible for mere mortals.  Absent a few key holds, this route would be much harder and perhaps dangerous.  This climb is a good climb overall, but is not to be taken lightly.  It is a obscure desert route, not a trade route.  Loose blocks, some lack of gear in places, generally in-obvious route finding, and other problems may present themselves to folks not enamored of desert towers.  If you are a qualified desert rat, however, this should be on your list of to-dos.   P1 (60', 5.9): Start on the right side in a crack with some blocks on a short pillar on the front of the North Sister and ascend 20 feet of 5.7 climbing to reach a short left-facing corner.  An old fixed pin will be visible once you are into that corner, but not from the ground.  Place a peice or two and start up the corner, clipping the pin and some more gear past an awkward move to reach a good ledge at perhaps 60' up.  Traverse right on that ledge past a fixed rap and build a belay below a small square roof with a very think crack through it's right side.   P2 (130', 5.10): Go up to the roof and festoon the tiny crack out the right side with small stoppers and cams and a short sling or none.  This will be crux protection.  Move down and out under the roof back to low angle rock and head to the right.  Climb up the face over there on slopers and  insecure edges back up and to the right facing corner above the roof and the gear that was placed in it.  If you fall here, you might hit the belayer, but not likely quite the ledge.  Get into the corner just before a ledge fall seems likely and make the tough descision about going up to a better stance or messing with gear while facing a bad fall from awkward stances.  I did the former and gunned it for a better stance before going for gear.  Get some protection and head up into a crack and corner system that becomes a chimney, protecting whenever possible.  You can stop and belay on 2 cams shoved down into the top of a crack on the right side 30' below the OW roof, or continue up past some loose rock to just below the OW roof at about 130' high.  That higher belay will be on a 300 lb block on a sloping ledge that moves when you shift your weight.  I built the belay there, having arrived, but then had my second settle in on the former option and belay there so as not to put 2 of us on the rocker-block on the sloping small ledge.   P3 (60', 5.10+): This is the money pitch and the crux.  Place gear up in the roof.  A 3\" and 4\" cam (or new #4 camamlot) work great.  Look out to the right over space to see some small footholds high and under the roof, then a good foothold on the arete, just out of reach.  Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to make your way out under that yawning crack though the roof (becomes 10\") past though smears on a steep face to a stance in the outside of that crack with a foot on that hold.  If you fail, I will disavow all knowledge of calling this 5.10.  It isn't \"5.10\" and \"OW\", it is \"5.10 OW.\"  But it is a spectacular sort of fun, and beta might spoil it, but both my partner and I had to get creative.  Continue past that crux and up into the slot that varies from OW to squeeze chimney.  Crux protection there is a new-style #4 and #5 camalot.  The #6 is too tight in most places, but I did eventually place it and was happy to have it since I did not have the #5 with me... (which I sorely wanted at a few points).

The route was reestablished with 2 or 3 new pitches on the bottom section.Pitch 1: Start at the original start and climb up through one of two hand cracks systems that gains a ledge up and to the right. There is a bolt for a small Traverse to a two bolt anchor. This anchor is just left of the major horizontal that can be seen from the ground. 5.10, Gear: BD 0.3 - 3. PG13 because of detached pillars and rock quality.Pitch 2: Hand traverse the horizontal crack for 30 feet. This crack will take anything from a BD .75-2. The crack does disappear for a few feet requiring some difficult face moves. Once at the junction of the horizontal crack and the vertical finger crack, build an anchor here. I used a BD .75, 3, and a red c3. 5.11+Pitch 3: If you don't mind the rope drag from pitch 2, don't build an anchor and just keep going up the calcite finger crack. Otherwise, \u00a0I would think most people would probably stop here and build an anchor. At the end of this 40 foot pitch, you'll land at the new anchor a few feet up and left of the old anchor (the anchor that was just above the pillar that fell). Gear: (Red C3's up to BD 0.5.) Solid 5.12. ***A crack has formed next to the crux crack on this pitch sometime between Jan. of '21 and Jan. of '24. There is a comparison photo of the crux in the photo gallery for reference.\u00a0Nothing new past this point... This is the original route.Pitch 4: The fourth pitch heads straight up ten feet, traverses left (.10+) and then goes up an easy corner (5.9) to a nice ledge.Pitch 5: follows the obvious 5.10 crack that trend up and left (wonderful thin hands). 5.10+ Gear: BD .4-2, mostly .75s and 1s.Pitch 6: Steps around the corner and makes a few 9+/10- face moves to the summit. 4 bolts.Rap the route with one 70 meter rope in 4 raps.",

I consider the pro list in the original description to be pretty bogus, but like I pointed out, people have done it with less than that.

We also threw a large stopper to back up the first belay, although it probably wasn't necessary. For the rap beta with one 60m rope:  Rap the first three raps to the top of the same flake you tunneled behind for pitch one.  The last rap is at the climbers right on the  flake/ledge from the belay anchor that is used for the top of pitch one climbing.  Shiny new hangers that drop you on the south prow in an easy rap.

It's actually quite a reach to that gaston flake and the feet are way low!  But totally doable.  And the last pitch is pretty tough if you're short.  I had to throw for the arete- very bouldery, but I stuck it and it was all good. All in all this is an amazing route and well worth the walk!  I thought the approach to the Rectory was way less steep than this one. Oh, and yes the forged friend is still there.  I could touch it and I felt it move, but since I was pumping out on lead, I didn't try to clean it ;) Apr 26, 2006",

If you want more, take #2 friends or #1 camalot, not a ton of .75s as stated earlier in the thread. You can also link both crux pitches pretty easily. Also the first move, right off the ground, is tricky. You might want to short rope that as a 60' pitch, then just walk across the ledge to start the squeeze. We rapped with a a single 60 in 3 raps.

I pride myself in the places I've taken a subie and wouldn't head up this wash in one unless I stole it. Appreciated the upgraded anchors by the way, especially at the top of the chimney.  A big improvement over the old flexy fixed angles!  Leaving the vintage hardware on the final pitch was a nice touch too. We took doubles to #2 with triple .75 and 1's and could protect roughly every body length. Could get away with a single #2 as it was only placed after the crux on fairly cruiser 5.8ish terrain.

The gear beta in this thread is pretty overwhelming so I'll resist adding another opinion except to say that I strongly recommend doing this route as two pitches. The first two historical pitches (to the top of the chimney) don't really require much gear so you (hopefully!) arrive at the start of the \"third\" pitch with almost the entire rack. Fire the crux, belay, then take it to the top of the tower. Rope management is easy, and due to the nature of the route (no need to sew up the chimney as the climbing is very secure), combining pitches doesn't require loads of extra gear. Pitching this out as five, or even four, sections is unnecessary for the vast majority of parties and no doubt contributes to Jah Man's clogged reputation. Feb 25, 2015",

Was shocked to discover the base of the P2 chimney has widened ~3 inches since the last time I did the route on 4/6/13. Back then, the crux of the pitch was getting into the chimney--a very tight squeeze, even for me at a lean buck-forty. This year I was able to waltz right into the thing. I shared my observation with a friend and fellow climber who is a geotechnical engineer. He gives the pillar that forms the chimney 10 years max before it calves, and thinks it could go at any time. To state the obvious, the loss of that pillar would change completely the nature of this climb, perhaps rendering it unclimbable (or at least a lot more difficult). Also to state the obvious, you don\u2019t want to be anywhere near the tower when the thing goes, much less in the chimney itself (maybe consider using the tower side exclusively for pro on that pitch?).

Access to the anchor was gained by climbing the 10-20' that remains of the original start to the route Jah Man and continuing up a right to left angling ramp to gain a bedding seam that was hand traversed from left to right for approximately 10 feet to gain the left of two crack systems. The left of the two crack systems was followed up to an area comprised of ledges where the two crack systems converge and where a directional protection bolt was placed. About 8' to the right of the directional protection bolt a fixed anchor was established at a ledge. This anchor was the end of the initial pitch  (5.10/ approximately 75'/ use long runners to reduce rope drag). From the anchor a second pitch was climbed via direct aid beginning with a horizontal left to right crack (1-3\") traverse of approximately 30' to a finger crack that ascends ~30+' to the pre-existing Jah-Man anchor (C-2 60ish feet/ good protection). The horizontal traverse of the second pitch was free climbed on top rope without falling from left to right at 5.11. The 2nd half of the 2nd pitch (from the end of the horizontal traverse to the pre-existing anchor) was free climbed on top rope with out falling at 5.12. Observations: The tower base area between the Jah Man and Nuns With Guns routes is unstable and actively settling. On Tuesday and Wednesday, Jan. 14th & 15th, spontaneous rock sliding in the impact area was occurring and continuing over the 50' rock band below the base. The 10-20' at the beginning of the start of Jah Man that remains appears to have shifted during the rock fall and may be unstable. Rope drag is a challenge due to the wandering nature of the 1st pitch and because of the depth of the v-slot with the hand crack in the back of it. A major portion of the south terminus of the tower is fractured and has serac-like features that appear potentially unstable. There are spontaneous and sporadic sand spin drifts propagating from the fractures in this area indicating movement. The first pitch (5.10+) of Nuns With Guns is gone with the the flake that fell. The second pitch (5.12) is in limbo above the anchor that had been accessed from the upper right side of the flake. The calcite face that was behind the flake is not featured in way that is conducive to free climbing. Be careful out there. Jan 16, 2020",
