A memorable line, Canary combines interesting climbing with terrific exposure.Approximately 100 feet to the left of Saber, a short section of face climbing leads to a right facing dihedral and a broken crack system that reaches the left side of Saber ledge. This is the start of Canary.P1. Begin by climbing approximately 15 feet of unprotected face to the base of a right facing dihedral. This section is not trivial, but the holds are positive and it is no harder than 5.7. Alternatively, it may be possible to begin in a small dihedral to the left and traverse right to gain the crack system at the top of the face. From the top of the face, follow the dihedral and subsequent crack systems up with good gear. Ascend until you are under the giant roof, then break right onto Saber ledge at the top of the crack system. This pitch is the technical crux of the climb, culminating in the moves up and onto Saber Ledge (5.8). Belay from gear or the giant eyebolts on the right of Saber Ledge.P2. From Saber ledge, contemplate what lies ahead. The second pitch begins with instant exposure, and the airy step off Saber ledge may be the pyschological crux of the climb. Begin by traversing obvious holds leading left and slightly up from Saber ledge. Though intimidating, the traverse is easier than it looks, and giant holds await you on the arete. It is possible to protect the traverse with a reasonable small alien on the face, otherwise it may be possible to place large gear (with long slings!) above Saber ledge before beginning. Upon reaching the arete, climb past two bolts and follow your nose and your gear.P3. From the alcove on the face, continue upwards on increasingly slabby terrain, following the intermittent cracks for protection. Like many routes on upper Castle, the exact line is not obvious; expect some runouts on easier terrain.. Belay at the top.To descend, follow the trail off the back of the summit to Logger's Ledge.",

It would be very difficult to reverse the moves you've made once you leave the ground. Many times I've seen people boldly start up then freeze in fear part way  because it dawns on them that they're really free soloing at that point.

Build an anchor in the alcove before the slabby, slightly run-out upper section for best results. Also, be prepared for your partner not to hear you.

Harder than I remember.    Lead / Flash. Led pitch 1,3; followed pitch 2, the airy exposure freezes you for real. I feel like the name \"Canary\" doesn't summarize the route especially pitch 2. Maybe smth like \"flash marriage\" etc, would make a better name to show how pitch 2 makes you feel? - It's fun for some people, and you keep telling yourself it's gonna be fine, yet your legs can't help shaking the closer you get.

Lead / Fell/Hung.    Follow. Alex lead all routes, and I followed. Amazing views. We ended up doing a very small third pitch.    Lead / Onsight. Got stuck in the coal mine for a little bit.

Old Grey Mare start was so much better, not run out.  I almost led 1st pitch clean, had to take a few times to get the last move. Getting the right foot established in the high V is key *before* trying to reach the finish jugs.  2nd pitch start has hidden funky #2 placement that helps a lot.  From there, continued 2nd pitch all the way to the summit.   1 pitch.  Follow.  \u2022 No names/notes    Follow. Followed clean, no falls. First pitch is vertical under roof 5.8+ climbing good pro. Second pitch is exposed first couple moves, protect with .3 in face hold, make two committing moves on good holds plug #2 in above jug, continue up to first bolt. Sustained 5.8+ climbing a lot of face moves. Third pitch is mostly chill, lots of runout but chunky climbing, look for fixed piton, made rope anchor off rock up top for epic topout.

Like it's neighbor Angel it is harder now that it is slippery at the start. The lower wide section protects well with a BD #4. After sliding that up with me, I get a #1 on the left wall and take the #4 for up higher. It is tricky to protect the chimney, can be done with small cams and brass nuts. The first ascent team used wood blocks to protect the wide parts and placed 1 bolt, which I have never spotted the remains of, unless it is the 1/4\" bolt near the top out.

Good rest platform 1/2ish way up. Burley chimney climbing with little holds/jams to the finish.    Lead / Onsight. Great route. Engaging moves the whole way (BC)    Lead / Flash. Was awkward, athletic, and a bit heady. Could have used very small or very large gear.    Lead / Onsight.    TR. Lower to chimney and climbed back up    TR.    Follow. Clean. James lead then mock lead trying to dial in start.    Lead / Fell/Hung.    Lead / Onsight. Climbed some time last month. Can't believe I waited so long to try it    TR.

I led up the the crack then bailed at the chimney. Ben followed that and then led 3/4 up the chimney and bailed there. I finished it off. then we continued on to the summit on Midway    Lead / Redpoint. Went back down for my single #4    Lead / Flash. Only used the 4 & 5 at the very top. A 6 seems like it would\u2019ve prevented a lot of fiddling with marginal pro.    TR.    TR.    TR. Rowdy!     TR.    TR. Tronsight  \u2022 No names/notes    TR.    TR.

TR. kind of did the chimney variation on tr almost the whole way.  w Chad, Andrew, Sudah    Follow. This was fun which I probably could have lead   2 pitches.  Lead / Fell/Hung. Awesome route. Burly! Should try for the send.     TR. lots of left shoulder scraping, lots of takes    Lead / Onsight. Much less intimidating than it looks from the ground. Ton of gear and features to stop this from being a pure crack. Would climb again.    TR.     Lead / Onsight. Fun route \nBumped a # 4 (2 #4s would be nice)on the lower then a # 6 on the upper upper took some finger size pieces to protect    TR.    Lead.    Follow.    Lead / Redpoint. Finally!! I am now worthy!     TR. Stellar!!! Probably something you want to headpoint\u2026or maybe someone should ad a bolt or too    TR. hmm, it turns out that the chimney and above is quite easy if ya just use chimney techniques the whole way...last time I turned around after the wide part, which ratchets up the difficulty. I was facing the road while chimneying, which seemed wrong before, but is definitely the way to go. The lower section is still as greasy as ever...    TR. Burly! Even on top rope. I obviously need more practice with this style of climbing.    Lead / Flash. Get your head together. Runout chimney    Lead / Redpoint.    Lead.    TR.    Lead / Fell/Hung.   2 pitches.  Lead / Fell/Hung. Physical but fun. No laybacking needed - jams and feet are there. #5 useless in the chimney, backed off the lead..Max was able to run it out and find some secret small gear, but still very bold  \u2022 No names/notes    Lead / Flash.    Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to back clean ALOT    TR. Clean on TR, hard first 15' and stays hard the whole way. Amazing climb!    Lead / Fell/Hung.    Lead / Fell/Hung. I entered the chimney with my back facing the road, which made it seemingly impossible to turn around at the constriction. Sooo, I pulled on my #6 to turn around. Otherwise, my send was clean. Next time I should save a #3 for use up high.     Lead / Onsight.  \u2022 No names/notes    TR.    Lead / Redpoint.    TR. Awesome climbing!!    Lead / Redpoint.    Lead / Onsight.  \u2022 No names/notes    Follow.    Lead / Onsight. didn't have a 4,5, or 6....  \u2022 No names/notes    TR. Climbed clean.

So this pitch might be one of the best in the state; great jams, stacks and stems the whole way. Not a single necessary lieback.    Lead / Onsight. super fun. fun layback to chimney stemming \n . exactly what you want for a chimney route    Lead / Fell/Hung.    Lead / Onsight. w dan, maggie, vera    Follow.     Lead / Onsight. Really odd gear, but a fantastic route! The crux felt down low with the two #4s, but the rest was more secure, just cryptic.    Lead / Onsight. tricky gear at top.  left shoulder in at upper chimney    TR. Not a lot of crack climbing for me. Got really big quickly. Top seemed spooky to lead but really fun climbing!",

Recently it came to my attention that there was some controversy surrounding Dan's Dreadful Direct, and I thought it appropriate I should add my voice to the equation, since I had the moment of privelege granted to me by Jim Yoder and had the belay and support of John Stoddard to free climb this wonderful route for the first time. Indeed, John's point of view, that the existing manky old fixed pin on Damnation Crack did contribute to some level of safety for the crux section of the route, is an accurate statement. It was an ackward clip, but it was also a critical piece of protection. Personally, I have no problem with the addition of a good bolt in a location that would be in about the same area as the original pin. One bolt is more than adequate. Additional bolts to make a sport climb of this route is not acceptable. When Jim, John, and I did the climb we did it with the idea of using the natural protection available on the climb. The use of RP's was critical to success, and I understand that new protection has replaced RP's as the gear of choice for ultra small placements. For many of my climbs I logged \"air time\" figuring out moves, with many a fall onto RP's down to #1 size. When used properly they provide psychological and sometimes real protection. Climbs that are conceived as bold statements of ability for control with long runouts over difficult rock should stand in as original condition as possible. In the event the original climb is altered with the loss of a fixed pin or bolt, then the climb should be restored to as near to original condition as possible. In my opinion this climb, while having an element of danger, was not a lethal proposition, but certainly had the potential for painful consequences for failure. Not all climbs are for all people. In fact the ability to do a given climb is a temporary condition and a privelege that should be enjoyed fully at the moment.

This protects very well and getting into and over the bulge at the bottom of the crack is the crux. After a 3-4 move sequence, you'll hit a bomber, incut jug in the crack and the route eases up.Definitely worth doing if you're in the area.

Hangdog...for me...lives in an entirely different universe of difficulty.  I'm 50% on TR...took me decades to lead it ONCE.  (After working the crap out of it on TR) I can see that if you had an insane strength to weight ratio it would be a different story. But back to mere mortals like me...I've onsighted hundreds of 5.11a routes over the 37 years I've been climbing.  Hangdog isn't even close to something I could ever onsight! My hardest onsight was 29 Palms in Josh...second hardest probably PegLeg in The Needles. Hardest redpoints?  Clay.  Insomnia (Suicide).  Red M and Ms.  Trella (Kalymnos).  Das Muzak.  Those are all similar in grade to Hangdog...so maybe Hangdog is tied with my hardest leads... I've climbed ROTC clean at least 200 times...mostly solo-TR, but plenty of redpoints and even a solo-lead.

Climbers seem to get lost on the 2nd pitch, it could be done in at least 3 different ways, all about the same grade and gear. The original line after crossing the void follows some old pins that can be hard to spot till on a big ledge, about 100', here is the improbable looking right trending traverse with a ring pin. It looks harder then 5.5, might be 5.7, but turns out to be easier then it looks. keep lower on the traverse to find pro till in wide gully like corner, follow this out veering right on ramp like crack to boulders at top.

We ran into a guide climbing next to us who said this is the route he takes his clients up if they request a good 5.8 multipitch. I can confirm this, as I\u2019m a new climber usually doing 5.7s and this route brutalized me. I could not have completed it without hang-dogging most moves. The \u201cchimney\u201d is small and you don\u2019t actually climb inside it, just alongside it. You can use it as a crack. If you have trouble getting up the \u201cchimney\u201d, the next two pitches are even harder. The top of the chimney is your last chance to rap down without leaving gear. Bring radios because you can\u2019t hear each other on Pitch 2 and 3. Pitch 1 has a bolted anchor. Pitch 2 and 3 need trad anchors. You can walk off the top down to the base of the route in 15 mins. The approach from the car is about another 15 mins. The end of Pitch 3 is kind of runout for maybe 20 feet until you top off. The hardest part of this climb is mentally doing the first move of Pitch 2. You have to stand up on the tiny top of Jello Tower and then stretch your hands and foot across a large gap of open air. If you don\u2019t make it, you fall down into the rocky chimney. Pitch 2 and 3 have many ledges that are a great quick break, but you could potentially hit if you fall when leading. Jun 2, 2018",

Approach was nice and shady. Route itself was relatively shady until just before noon. Some loose rock made this interesting. Fun but challenging route.

Followed Amy up this route.  Tricky jump and traverse    Lead / Flash. 2#4 and 1#5 would be nice to protect pitch 1 for new lead to stay calm. Crux comes to the final part, gaining the tower from a ledge, as the main wall is too clean, and I right knee jammed in the large crack, left foot stem on the tower, would be nice to protect with #4; to start pitch 2, stand as close to the main wall as possible, lean onto it with hands, move right foot over, place a pro, then push onto the main wall with left foot, climb up the corner onto a ledge to the left, traverse right aim for the ring, looking for good foot holds, hands on crack where pros can be placed, once reach the gully, climb up through it, reaching the belay station, build gear anchor; didn't remember the details of pitch 3, mostly traverse up and right meeting a sweet deep crack, climb along the crack, then take the least steep line on the right edge (no pro here but quite easy slab), wrap around the horn as anchor.    Lead / Onsight. W Jeremy \nLed p2\nFun and beautiful river view\nLots of pitons\n#4 and #5 helpful    Lead.    Lead / Onsight. First climb post injury. Felt like old school 5.6 for sure, it was real wild climbing this thing and thinking of Fred Beckey doing the same in 1948 with less than ideal gear lol. Great outing after a solid weekend of music!    Lead.    Lead / Redpoint. With Jose. \n\nHe head P1, did a solid job. \n\nI took P2/3, reckon Jose\u2019s multipitch skills are coming along.

Led all three pitches. \n1st pitch - used a #4 in the wider crack above (crux move). Laying back on the main wall and using the jello tower for smearing (chimney move) and using the heel toe technique for the crack. \n2nd pitch - Start was airy - lying on the main wall and right leg on it used a yellow totam to protect (I asked the follower from the party before us to place it for me to avoid a factor 2 fall incase I wasn\u2019t able to make the move). I went up and traversed right a bit using the finger crack and went up diagonally again. In hindsight I should have traversed  right low and gone to the wide gully and up. That would have been easier. Belayed from gear for this pitch. \nPitch 3 - easier pitch and a bit run out at the end. Just used a purple totam on the crack and went up. \nWalk off - Easy walk off leading to a trail.    Follow.  \u2022 No names/notes   1 pitch.  Lead / Flash. P2. Followed by Conrad C.

Not a great first 5.6 multi pitch for the 5.6 multi pitch leader but a really great climb:  great pro, fun moves, very picturesque, easy legit walkoff, and more!  Clip-a-piton fun.     Lead.

Led all pitches.  \u2022 No names/notes   1 pitch.  Lead / Redpoint. P1    Lead / Onsight.    Follow. with Nick    Lead. Climbed with Grace. Quite fun. No 4 this time, so the protection through the first pitch was just small cams. Kind of committing there until you reach the piton. Awkward but less awkward than last time. P1 belay is awkward. The step across wasn't bad and you can place a piece (.75 I think) before doing it. And also a yellow Metolius up higher in a nice little crack. Didn't even clip the piton, it looks like the head is kind of bent and hard to clip anyways. Second pitch was great. Went straight up for a ways and found the ring pin. Traverse was fun. A little heady but solid. Third pitch is fine, pretty easy, not super long. Beautiful horn up top to sling to belay from. Walk off wasn't too bad or too long. Overall a fun route. It's in the sun so would be nice on a cooler day.

Super fun route, stiff for 5.6 (at least the chimney). Appreciated having the 4\u201d topping out the chimney & for the belay (one can clean it after topping out Jello Tower). Beneficial to climb through to the alcove stance using 3\u201d/4\u201d & tips for anchor. \n\nBump up & right after 20\u2019 climbing. Traverse was awesome, funky pro led to great corner/ ledge belay w small nut, \u201c1, & purple totem. \n\nFunky start & initial 20\u2019 to the awesome hand crack to wicked cool puzzle-hueco face. Pro was thin, a wrong sequence could prove dangerous but otherwise it is simple & fun! \n\nPlentiful boulder/ horn belay options on the summit. \n\n3.5/4*  \u2022 No names/notes    Lead.

Instead of the squeeze tunnel of normal Midway, Direct goes up and then slightly left after the Jello Tower step across. Follow the shallow dihedral up about 45 feet until it ends and is capped by an 8 inch roof. At this point there is a 20 foot exposed, runnout traverse across to the right to regular Midway...but don't do that! Instead, place a bomber hand sized piece and move up and left on the vertical face. It looks completely unprotectable and blank, but there are super secure incut edges along with slots for bomber small wired nuts. The rock is clean and you are never more than 8 feet from great pro. Climb up and left  following the clean rock and good gear until you get to the ledge where a small tree is growing. From the tree-bush, go up and then left following the crack systems to a great belay alcove. One more shortish pitch will put you on top. Bring a camera, the sheer exposed face with views down to the river are awesome! Oct 4, 2023",

Former PNW crusher Kyle O'Meara envisioned a direct start up beautiful white rock which would allow the route to be climbed in one pitch. Unfortunatly, Kyle ran out of bolts, and was only able to sink in the first three. Nonetheless it didnt keep Kyle from freeing the line with a stick clip to start and traditional pro (a few cams and a sea of manky fixed pins) through the upper crux bulge. This half-finished pseudo-\"traditional\" version saw possibly just one additional free ascent over the next few years. In the spring of 2014, Dave Morales, added the missing couple of bolts to the direct start, replaced the manky fixed pins through the upper crux with bolts, and added a lower 2-bolt anchor.The route begins with beautiful climbing using perfect edges and side-pulls on aesthetic white stone. From a midway rest ledge a perplexing bouldery crux leads to a more moderate finish up a shallow corner system.",

Look for a left angling ramp just to the right of a large, low roof.  This is the start of Saber.P1.  Climb the left angling ramp to the base of a left facing dihedral.  The rock in the dihedral has been polished to a slippery, disconcerting, mirror-like sheen.  When you hit a diaganol crack heading up to the left follow it to Saber ledge.  Belay from bolts. (~90 feet)P2.  A few easy moves (~5.5) on the left side of a wide chimney take you up onto emminently forgettable and blocky terrain.  The climbing gets easier as you ascend, and I found myself on 4th or 3rd class terrain long before reaching the top of Castle rock (~190 feet).I've stuck with the historical rating for this climb, which may be a bit of a sandbag-- a more realistic rating for the first pitch may be 5.6.  Combined with the polished rock, this route is probably not the best choice for a fledgling trad leader.  One star for history and for being an accesible moderate as well as a good place to booty gear, but I can't imagine wanting to do this twice.",

Definitely stiff for the grade the way I did it, but it was a blast with some very committing moves. The start was an awesome boulder problem, maybe V1 or V2. You'll notice that in the picture that after the boulder problem I started going right and then back left into the crack system. I'm not sure if that's the exact location in the picture but as you're making your way up after the boulder problem, you'll get to a point where it starts becoming an overhang, sorta. I didn't feel comfortable going up that overhang (also unable to place pro at this point) and saw some good holds to the right. At the time, I felt like that was the best approach to the problem. After talking to a friend who did the climb a year ago, he mentioned an easier way: starting right and traversing left to the zig zag crack line and then working your way up the horizontal cracks (pictured below). I haven't tried this way. My partners and I turned the second pitch into 2 pitches. The 2nd part of the second pitch is definitely a scramble, but you'll want to place some gear nonetheless. I hope the pictures help. Jun 3, 2014",

Stayed too far right and did the finger crack lay back variation. Failed to find the belay anchors but it all worked out   3 pitches.  Lead / Onsight. Ella P1   4 pitches.  Follow. With Kyle... Not going to claim lead. Starting move is stiff and remains sustained through the little roof problem. Then eases up to first place we built anchor (to better see the follower off deck). Fun airy traverse to left to next anchor. Then a wandering slabby area where I found hard to protect. Finally, chossy junk to the summit for a boulder belay.    Lead.    Follow.    Lead / Redpoint.    Lead / Flash.    Lead. Swung leads  \u2022 No names/notes    Follow. Couldn\u2019t get the start; took alternate route and got lowered to 1st 2 pieces then got dropped (fall). Attempted to lead 2nd pitch, failed, switched leads.    Lead / Onsight. Took Andy    Lead / Onsight. First pitch going left at the flakes to avoid bees. Missed ledge, so went right around corner and up. Horrendous rope drag, but linked a 70m to rock with arch at top    Follow. First pitch. Went up right and connected to some route over there    Lead.   4 pitches.  Follow.   4 pitches.    Lead / Flash.   Go left at pin blocky section. Right is off route and doesn\u2019t go    Lead / Onsight. Got off route near end of P1. Trended left underneath a large roof belayed at a micro ledge w 1\u201d, 2\u201d, 4\u201d \n\nP2 straight up & right on small cams right above the belay lol. Trend right then straight up for easy slab w small options for gear, belay at alcove. \n\nJose took P3 to the top on scrambling terrain  \u2022 No names/notes    Lead.  \u2022 No names/notes    Lead / Onsight.

Much easier, but lots of rope drag.    Follow. Followed Ben, 1st pitch goes all the way to left after 2 X-marked rocks, over a bigger ledge. 2nd pitch felt tricky even though supposed to be easier. Would not lead myself yet this route.    Follow.   Just P1    Follow.  \u2022 No names/notes    Lead. P1    Lead / Fell/Hung. With Shelby from SpaceX and his friend Patrick. A few moves felt like solid 5.8+. Not great feet in the harder sections. No bolts at top, needed to sling a horn with the climbing rope. Wouldn\u2019t repeat.    Lead.  \u2022 No names/notes    Follow.    Lead.    Follow.    Lead / Flash. Pitch 1 felt more like 5.7 on lead (or I just suck at chimney climbing). The first few moves to get on the route were more like 5.8/5.9. It's the bouldery direct-start section.....maybe I wasn't supposed to start from there? I cheated this part with some aid climbing involved. Pitch 2 (or pitch 3 in my case) was pretty chill for the most parts except for serious rope drag, and I ran out of alpine draws    Follow.

Anchor bolts farther left on the ledge than you think    Lead. With Carly   1 pitch.  Lead / Onsight. Only did the first pitch before setting up a TR on the first pitch of Canary. I did not have any small cams upon reaching the slab + corner finger crack so ended up running it out. This part probably protects best with .3s, there are possible nut placements but a bit finicky.   Not exact date. Mich fell ill so we only did 1st pitch.    Lead / Onsight.

We stopped at the bolted anchors 30 feet? before the tree. (mostly because that it was what the party before us did). The corner/groove leading up to the second crux was a little sketch...mostly due to moss, but the protection was not super awesome. Moss made it look like it doesn't see much traffic. Rock in that area sided on the edge of hollow in my opinion...and since when are rusted pitons placed likely 30+ years ago called \"good?\" We belayed at the ledge below the second crux. (The party ahead of us bailed here bc they got sketched out at the crux). At the second crux, I climbed the crack just before the arete to do this part...thought i could get more gear? ...which was fine, but again...that old bolt/hanger has seen much better days, and blowing it before getting a second piece would of super sucked no matter how you did it. Rest of pitch 3 was fun, but definitely warm in the sun! Best for a bit of a cooler day. First 2 pitches stayed in the shade pretty late, so that was awesome. (one of the bigger reasons we did it). Where we stopped for our belays did not really affect the climb for better or worse (that I could tell). Long story short...climb was fun/worth doing, but did not always have super bomber gear (in my opinion), so be prepared for a little spice. <3 Jul 7, 2014",

But bailed from there after being unsure where the route went, The Karamar guide didn't have the best description. Searched around through the moss for a while but decided not to continue as the only reasonable option looked unprotectable (turns out it was the right way after all). A 70m rope barely made it back to the ground from there. UPDATE: Just went back and successfully finished the route. The gear is definitely a little sparse and iffy, but always where I wanted it. The bolt felt poorly placed in my opinion, a little higher and maybe it would protect you from breaking your ankle on the ledge, if you were to blow the face moves. Regarding the moss and lichen, I noticed that on the second pitch every worth while foot and hand hold was relatively clean, while on the easier terrain I couldn't always tell if I was crimping on lichen or an edge. There were also a few cracks that almost looked like they would take gear with a little cleaning. Overall I found this to be a very enjoyable climb on upper castle, with a little more attention I think this climb could be just as popular as canary or the other 5.8's on castle May 1, 2017",
