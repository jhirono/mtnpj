Visit: facebook.com/friendsofindia\u2026 saltlakeclimbers.org/news/2\u2026 2024 Raptor Avoidance Areas (LIFTED 9/10/2024)- The Wall, Far Side, The Meat Walls, Cliffs of Insanity, Public Service Wall, Disappointment Cliffs, Fin Wall, Broken Tooth, Cat Wall, Slug Wall, and Reservoir Wall. See map in photos section. Each spring raptors return to the Indian Creek area for nesting. Eagles, falcons, hawks, and other migratory birds use shallow depressions on ledges, cliffs and rock walls to build nests, often returning to the same site year after year to raise their young. The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) requests that visitors and recreationists avoid these areas during critical nesting periods which typically start in early March and last through late August. Avoiding recreational activity in the vicinity of the nest sites along and maintaining a safe viewing distance will help ensure survival of young birds. Beginning March 1, the public is asked to avoid climbing in areas that are historically known to have raptor nesting activity or have a high potential for nesting. Areas that have potential nesting activity are referred to in many climbing guidebooks as: The Wall, Far Side, The Meat Walls, Cliffs of Insanity, Public Service Wall, Disappointment Cliffs, Fin Wall, Broken Tooth, Cat Wall, Slug Wall, Reservoir Wall and Critic\u2019s Choice. While this list serves as a guide, it does not indicate every avoidance area or encompass all known names of the affected climbing areas. Please refer to the provided \u201cRaptor Protection Map\u201d to identify avoidance areas.  The BLM is coordinating these raptor protection efforts with the Utah School and Institutional Trust Lands Administration, who is the administrator of the climbing areas known as Disappointment Cliffs and portions of the Second Meat Wall climbing area. The avoidance areas only cover a portion of Disappointment Cliffs, see the map for additional details. In March, BLM biologists will begin the annual surveys of raptor activity to verify which historic nest sites are being used. Typically, by late April or early May, biologists can identify the nesting areas the raptors have selected. At that time the areas without active nests will be cleared for recreational use. The BLM requests that climbers, campers, and hikers completely avoid areas with active nests until the young birds have fledged, which is usually by late summer. Biologists will monitor nesting activity throughout the season and keep the recreation community informed of potential changes. Avoidance area notices and maps will be posted throughout the Indian Creek Corridor during the recreation season. While falcons and eagles are not overly common sights in southeastern Utah, they are present throughout the area and keen-eyed observers are sometimes rewarded with their aerial acrobatics. Visitors can watch adult birds hunt or observe the antics of young raptors perfecting their flying techniques. These species in Utah continue to recover from low population levels, thanks in part to cooperation from the public, climbing communities and governmental partners. The BLM would like to remind the public there are private land holdings throughout the Indian Creek Corridor. Please respect private landowners\u2019 boundaries and signage. For questions about this avoidance areas, raptors, and migratory bird habitat in the Monticello area, please contact Rachel Wootton with the BLM Monticello Field Office at 435-587-1500. Persons who use a telecommunications device for the deaf (TTY) may call 711 to leave a message or question. The TTY Relay System is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Replies are provided during normal business hours. blm.gov/announcement/blm-an\u2026 WET ROCK: Holds rip off and climbs have been and will continue to be permanently damaged due to climbers not respecting this phenomenon. After a heavy storm the rock will remain wet, sometimes for several days. PLEASE DO NOT CLIMB IN MOAB during or after rain. RAPTOR CLOSURES: please be aware of seasonal raptor closures. They occur annually in the spring.",

The bolts are all sound, but the some of  the chains and rings are pretty worn.  The quicklink on the right anchor on Supercrack is worn about 60% through(top and bottom).  Amazingly enough a group was toproping THROUGH the anchor.  I had an extra quicklink, but no pliers to unscrew the old one.  I was hoping some of the regulars might think about updating some quick links here and there.  Hopefully, next time I'll have some extras and some pliers/cutters to make these a little safer.  I'd be nice if just a few people left some new gear so we don't have to be witness to a splatter. Feb 23, 2004",

Didn\u2019t have the endurance to get it clean, but fun climb nonetheless! \u00b7 Lead. 1 x 0.5, 1 x 0.75 or 1, 6-7 x #2 Rack on left side \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Great, easiest on wall, mostly ones and twos, a 0.5 works to protect the mantle at top a little deep or maybe another #2? \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung to figure the bulge out, excellent first 5.9 lead. Hands at top are stellar \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. W/ Adrian. Great climb for him, bigger feet and features on left. I loved this climb, got a little scared towards top when it got steep again. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. .5 as first and last piece, 3x #2\u2019s in between. Great warmup / first lead. Wide section before splitter is crux. New leaders may want an additional 1-2x #2\u2019s to sew it up. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fun hand crack for second half. Felt good climbing above gear to the anchor. Hung 3 times to get gear from lower in crack. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Pretty good route - can either stick to the crack or pull some thin face moves for the first bulge. All #2s after that \u00b7 Lead / Flash. It was snowing. My feet were slipping everywhere. Snow in my chalk bag. Pumped out at the top but that last .75 and a horizontal fist jam gave me all the confidence I needed to pebble wrestle my way to the top. Brought 4 2's and did not regret it \u00b7 TR. Did several run on this route to get hang of crack climbing on the corner. It seem I got it at then end. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. ok route, I should have taken more twos, lowered and then hung just before the top blocks. I put in a .75, a 1, a bunch of 2s and a final 1 where the 2 crack constructs before the blocks. the blocks are loose so putting a finger cam would be a bad idea it's probably a 9. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. .5, .75, 5 x2 and a 1. Crux is probably the bulge. For me it was where it steepens out and thins near the top. Don\u2019t place gear in the loose blocks. Nate shouted \u201cjust go for it\u201d which is exactly what I needed. Happy to cleanly lead something here at the creek! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. 2 1\u2019s and 2 2\u2019s with a little Bumping. 3rd number two would prevent the need For bumpin. Optional .75 early \u00b7 3 pitches. TR. Done with Trevor and Corrine. I would have led it, but Trevor put the rope up and ended up overextending my #2 wild-country. Spend the next hour hammering on it and got it out! The climb itself was fantastic with a splitter hand crack with an interesting roof to pull over at the beginning. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. foot slipped after placing the yellow 2 at the top. grrrr so close. keep both feet in the crack... gear purple .5 red 1 green metolius to protect crux sew up crack with yellow 2 and blue metoulius save one yellow for horizontal crack at the top \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Really fun route. Had to solo up to just below the bulge twice to unstuck the rope. Make sure to pull the climbers side. I found the crux to be pulling over the top. On of my favorite easy routes at the creek \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Used 5 #2, 1 #1, 1#4 (good for the bottom but optional), 1 #0.4 (top). All Camelots \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. my gear... 0.5 to 1 good a the bottom. green metolius to blue metolius all through crack. take as many as you can. save a yellow 2 for the horizontal crack at the top. I got a blue metoulius stuck at the top of the crack and had to hang on a yellow 2 to get it out. ultimately a green metolius fit way better here. first time hanging on gear! \u00b7 TR. Crux at the bulge: jam left at highest available point in the wide notch, get high feet on the face, and stand up into the bulge to get a high right hand jam, and then enjoy the nice crack the rest of the way. There are a couple spots after the bulge to smear on the left for a reprieve for the feet and a shake-out if needed. This was a good follow-on for me after Twin Crack 5.8+ farther left on Supercrack Buttress. Took on TR the first go, and sent it clean the second time around with better technique and having the beta better understood. Where Twin Crack starts in the corner and goes to the face, this one stays in the corner the whole way, so it forced a bit different technique. Fun climb! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. 3 2.0s 1 0.75 A beginner leader may want another .75 and a 1.0 low and another 2.0 \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Have come a long way since the last time I climbed this! Still fun. Used #0.5, #0.75 (or another 0.5), 2x #1s, 3-4x #2."

Ate up and spit out on this lead. 3 #3's, a couple #3's and LOTS of #2's next time. Get strong for the creek and return! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Oh my god this was so hard for me. The fist section felt impossibly difficult. Took my first big whips on gear. Emphasis on whips plural. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 2 or 3 hang. Focus on fists with left hand leading in some of the bigger pods \u00b7 Lead. 1s to the roof and then short section of 2s and then lots of 3s! Heavy on the right arm \u00b7 TR. quick Tr burn since there was a mega line. small section of fingers to get to the goods. maybe a low .4 and then a high .75 before the hands. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Super hard but proud I tried this as my first creek lead! I probably fell 5 times, mostly in the 3s. I brought .4, .75, 4 1s, 6 2s, and 6 3s and I used all of it while also bumping gear. Happy though \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. My first trad lead. Went piece to piece. Fell on a #1. Looked like I\u2019d gone swimming I was so sweaty by the end. Probably took me an hour to get up. Excited to make this feel smooth with more practice. \u00b7 Lead. Clean send! 3s at the top felt harder than the 1s at the start for some reason. I like this one better than Incredible \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Fought through the 1s and then plowed it through the perfect hands. Bring a .5 for the start \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. 1\u201d-3\u201d R facing dihedral. Long consistent climbing. Somehow managed to get my shoe lace loop caught in a cam. Fun route! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Led to about halfway, got scared at the larger 3 crack. Lie backed the top section on TR \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Rodny, Agreen, and I put this up. Long. Sustained. Pumpy right arm. Can rest using left side pull and head against wall with right foot cranked and left foot out on face. \u00b7 Lead. Led the middle section. We led it as a group. A ton of 1s and 2s and 3s. \u00b7 TR. @Crack Camp! Definitely one I want to come back and lead. Loved the progressive change in crack size from thin hands to fists. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Slipped right off the block for the reds, oh well. Really fun and pumpy route. Good to do again! \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. 1s went easy, maybe it was the new BD crack gloves or maybe I got stronger\u2026 who knows\u2026 top ate my arm skin and was super pumpy\u2026 stoke! \u00b7 TR. Crack Camp. Holy moly what a pitch! Made it to just below the rest ledge before taking. Baggy fist section was the most strenuous for me - had to take a few times (3-4?). Perfect fists & hands sections were just pure joy. \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead. Phew. Lots of threes. Tough and very fun climb! Lead and then TR \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. 2x .75 4x #1 2x orange totem 5x #2 3x #3 (Resist urge to bring #4) .75 above pedestal will walk deep! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. So pumpy!! Midway stem rest, arm levers, and crimp jams were key to my success! Very very fun route. I think I placed .4, .75, 3x1, and maybe 5 or 6 2\u2019s, maybe 4 3\u2019s \u00b7 TR. Did NOT finish. Fist size 3s were absolute hell for me and only got thru the second half before wimping out. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Led this like trash. Off the ground is so greasy. Then it\u2019s just sustained. No move hard, just an enduro-run. Take lots of 1, 2, 3 \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Finger sequencey boulder start on pillar. Then rest on pillar to #1s for 10 ft to a good hand, pods and little feet features made it just doable. Pull the bulge. Endurance fest To top. 2s and 3s. Musseys. 70 m. With sarah . Little kid doing first trad lead on twin cracks thought saw tommy caldwell because of seeing his shoes. Dad wad really encouraging the kid to not worry about grades. I thanked them for that. \u00b7 TR. Thin start, had a hard time. Then great size for me up to the roof. Pulled it on second attempt. The rest was slightly big for me, hands cramping were the main issue. Fitness required A kid running around the crag said Tommy Caldwell was here, I was so excited and wanted Erron to hurry. Then the kid came back and said false alarm, I saw his shoes (TC pros) and thought it was him \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. w/ Jbraud. Great climb, pretty cool to work through all the sizes. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Really on you the whole time in terms of difficulty probably close to my on sight limit considering my biceps \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung 3x bc of my horrible endurance, but this was my favorite route of the weekend! Will definitely be back to give it a better effort! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Start is thin, I just liebacked shamelesssly to get to the good stuff. Then cruiser jams all the way up, just have to fight the pump. \u00b7 TR. Jugged up a good amount after thin hands section cuz daylight was going. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Stoked on the flash. So freakin tiring, was exhausted like half way up. Brought 4 #2s and #3s each but back cleaned a couple. 6 of each would be nice. The #2 section was awesome \u00b7 TR. 3\u2019s section was hard\u2026got it clean on TR but would be hard to lead \u00b7 TR. Fell once at start, then got a clean TR run. This one goes for days! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at the #1 roof. Sent the rest from where I fell. Using tape gloves instead of my OR ones might make the 1s crux easier... hmmm.. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Encouraged again as the crew as the rain started to fall. Never has clipping draws been so hard. Took one big whip in the middle when rope was hard to unpin from my foot and was in bad fists. Chloe caught me and gear did too. Pretty stellar. So so tired. \u00b7 Lead. Oh baby did I hang on some cams A lot of them Pretty much every other/every placement if I\u2019m being honest, especially in the #3 section Had a hard time getting my left hand to stay in and it was grueling to bump up my right I was also scared and bumping cams and placing a lot, which wasted energy Took me like an hour Proud for sticking with it, gotta mentally get used to this style of climbing so I trust myself more. My middle knuckles kill from cupping and struggling to get my hands to stay in size 3 size Wished I had another 3 at the top, I brought 5 and 6 would have been perfect I used 5 #1, 5 #2 and 5 #3 and a .5 and .75 down low Yeehaw \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. First climb in Indian Creek, this one is a long one! I was nervous about warming up on it, but decided to give it a go anyway with parties swamping the place. Did very well with the #1 section down low. In the #2s I got pumped from not resting effectively and stepping on my rope in the crack a bunch. Managed to shake out and make slow progress up the sustained hand crack. Wild \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Pas \u00e9t\u00e9 capable de finir! Les coincements en dessous du toit ont eu raison de moi, tr\u00e8s pompant vu la plus petite taille. \u00b7 TR. nice folks set up toprope, i fell a bunch but ethan rocked it \u00b7 TR. lily was not a big fan of this one, but good practice! 1st indian creek mega splitter that our nuclear engineer friends set for us"

Was able to use cupped fists, but re-did the section with butterflies after the send. Would come back for P2 \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Somebody needs to teach me how to off width. Take 3 4s and a 5 if you're bad at wideness like me \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Wtf that bulge felt parts of me that I didn\u2019t know could be touched (both emotionally and physically) \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Top was cool, did a chimney and then layback and grab crimp on left to mantle \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Easy through the first half, tough as it widens out. Ended up climbing the crux more on the face than the offwidth Shoutout to Liam for the belay \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Arametto corner * 3-4x2 * 3-4x3 * 3-4x4 * 1x5 Stacks on stacks. Inch worm up baby See if I can get one friend 4 vs BD 4. But still good if not \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead. 3-4 x 2s, 3-4 x 3s, 3-4 x 4s, 1 x 5 \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Really awkward gettin into the #5 offwidth. Protects well with 4.5 above \u00b7 1 pitch. Follow. With Mitch and Jill pickle. Not clean. Not clean at all. \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Ryan lead. Super fun low-angle crack with the off-width upper bulge crux (wide stance/smear and bear hug finish). \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. First pitch only, almost got knee stuck in OW (stack + knee works well for getting past overhang) \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Struggle on the offwidth. Forearm/bicep jams. Fuzzy bat sleeping in the crack left of the P1 anchor. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Just did the first pitch, was reminded that offwidths are work. Nice to have 2x#4 or a 4 and a 5. Otherwise super cruiser hands to wide hands crack \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Stick with at the 5s! Gaston, bump feet into crack, arm bar to glory! \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. TR SEND. Had tried onsight on lead but had only 1x #4. So bailed. Hard OW \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. Much better go this year the #5 section up top felt much more easier. \u00b7 1 pitch. Follow. Finished the off width of pitch 1 on lead. One take \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. I would give it a ten starts with easy hand jams with 2s than maybe one 3 the rest will be 4s. Came down because I did not bring enough 4s. Restarted from the beginning and was able to finish hung twice in off width before bulge but had some nice butterflies and finished bulge clean. Lots of fun looking forward to try again. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Had fun at the bottom, then worked through the wide easier part. Fell at the steep off-width and ended up with my head into the wall with feet into the right facing lip, grunted into a mantle to finish. \u00b7 1 pitch. #4 section was really tough for me to figure out. The bulge top out protects well and has great features on the face to use \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. overhung 5s are hard. could get a butterfly a d use the foot holds out left \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Only did first pitch, got knee really stuck at the bulge, needed someone to come save me \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. couldn't pull the end moves; MUST BE REPEATED IN THE FUTURE \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Mega beached whale move at the top. pretty fun. Gear: #2, #3, #3, #4, #4, #5. Could have used an extra #4. Some may appreciate an extra #2 \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Only did the first pitch. What a warmup. This is a sandbag, and not just because it's wide. I thought that the moves were at least 5.10-. With Kat. \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Holy fork the top off width section was exhausting. Still trying to figure out how the full-foot cam works \u00b7 TR. Fun trickery pulling the bulge, stacked hands into crimps on the face for the mantle, nice knee jam too. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Holy mother of all beach whale top outs. Hand stacks until you can slither awkwardly up on top. Don\u2019t know what a 4.5 is but wish I had one. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell once on the first OW crux after getting the rope stuck on my foot. Had the top down. Felt wayyyyy easier than last year. What a good feeling. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. Just did the first pitch. Very good for training off-width. \u00b7 1 pitch. Follow. hung at the OW. led by Kyle, super fun. Mike led afterwards \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Got heat exhaustion near the top and almost threw up. Bottom was really fun and good, but then struggling through the OW at the top I had to take and couldn\u2019t catch my breath. Lowered and got in the shade. Friends don\u2019t let friends climb OW in the sun \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. good spot for beginners, muscle your way out the offwidth roof thingy \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Amazingly fun climb on TR, would be a bit stressed on lead lol. #1, #2, #3, #4, #4, #5 \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell on P1 at the OW. Thought this was a warmup. Nope. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Fun OW at top. Used #4 and #5. Two 4s would have been better \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. One hung, but totally doable. Use the nice foot at the first wide section, it helps. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. god damn off width at the end are me for breakfast \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Flash. P1 only. woooo. fun bit of OW greatly protected by #5. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. first pitch only. did pretty good until the bulge. first time moving on stacks \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. First pitch only. Indian creek beat down. Logged some exciting air time. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Climbed the top half after my friends cruxed out half way up. Something about the size of my arm let me bicep/forearm jam while bumping a tight #5 through the top section. Definitely one you lay on top after beached whaling it and breath for a bit. One of my favorite routes I\u2019ve done. Starts out with thin hands, then goes to big hands then to offwidth. Used 2-3 #4s. And 2 #5s. A #6 could replace the lower #5 \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. W/ matt. Retro tick, can\u2019t remember exactly when. I thought it was very fun."

TR lap after \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. bring more greens and purple cams. 6 runners + anchor were just enough. \u00b7 Lead. Erika; didn't have enough .5's. next time would bring at least 9 purples.

Lead to the stem - pumped out and realized I didn\u2019t have #1s - TRed \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Laybacks galore, almost exploded a bicept 2 x.4, 6 x .5, 3 x .75, 2 x 1, 1 x 2, 1 x 3 \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Long pitch. Ran out of gear, had to lower to back clean. With Julia. \u00b7 TR. mock led. would want a lot of .5s and .75s but think I could lead clean. lots of laybacking but with rests and then a chimney rest. \u00b7 TR. This was a little too hard for me but an enjoyable experience nonetheless! Got practice and exposure on finga jammin techniques!!! \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Tried leading before. Got it clean today. Then top roped in about 1/5 the time. \u00b7 TR. Soo looong.... couple hangs, cost me skin & sensation in my R index finger \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Not in great fingers/thin hands shape but this kicked my butt! sweet route tho \u00b7 TR. First ever 5.11 cool hard lay back crack. Had to take lots of rests. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Woah. Total pump fest. Great rests, strong and sustained, great view. Total high point in my trad career so far. Rock sign at the bottom is awesome \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Two hangs at high roof. Enduro route for 5.10+\\5.11- leader. Awesome! \u00b7 OS. No single crux move. Just long and sustained. Lots of .5 and .75 gear \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Almost OS. Fell at last hard move. 25 footer.

Double in fingers to 0.5, 0.75, (five) 1, (three) 2, (two) 3, 4, many alpine slings. Save a 3 for the top \u00b7 Lead. Bring a couple small blues , full rack , several 1, .5, two .75, several 2 a couple 3 and a 4 Great finger locks at the beginning . Roof is tough , little buldge you can lock wrist \u00b7 TR. A rad route indeed! A little bit of everything. I thought the cruxes were down low in the rattly fingers and thin hands parts. Roofs are easier than they look although I was cooked by then. Hung a time or two down low \u00b7 Best route of trip, varied climbing requiring many techniques and sizes. Best on wall \u00b7 Follow. Tried to lead, 0.5 section worked me hard. Bring a 0.2 for the bottom and a 0.4 for the awkward dihedral. Top is fun, and less cruxy than you\u2019d think. Chimney the first overhang. 0.5 section felt like the crux and keeping endurance \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Gotta start extending draws below the roof.. I had to go back up with a nut tool taped to a stick to fish two cams out \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Cruxy section before the chock stone protects with .4, and then you can get a blue totem next to the chock stone and a 4 above it. Didn\u2019t use any .5 \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. A fight, wowzerz. Big fun. Bring 3 #3s next time, and maybe even a 4. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. I was scared to hop on this but felt called to try. Manteling into the pod was super awkward, but I found using my feet well in the finger crack served me much better than I thought, they are sticky. Didn\u2019t have a 0.4 so I placed a passive pink tricam. The layback wasn\u2019t as bad as I thought, and I cruised the thin hands with good footwork. Was able to chimney up to the roofs and rest. Roof was extra pumpy because I had to keep back cleaning (need more #2s). I was able to very effectively shake out on steep hand jams. Overall the theme here is trust the jams and the feet even if you think they suck, they don\u2019t! \u00b7 Follow. Wowe Really cool, challenging climb Getting on the pedestal in the middle of the finger section is awkward, had to use my knees and I\u2019m pretty flexible so idk the beta there I have to work on hand crack endurance, my thumb muscle was pumping out \u00b7 TR. INCREDIBLE. would love to lead one day. TR\u2019d clean with lots of umphing \u00b7 Excellent route! Fingies, small hands, big hands, stemmy roof pulls this one\u2019s got it all! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Amazing amazing climb. Small fall at the beginning then a take before the 1s section. Keep pushing and fighting the pump! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. really really burly, did late in the day in the sun and 4hung or something after hanging in the awkward fingers section. don't climb in the sun and probably don't climb at all unless in the mood for a burlfest. \u00b7 TR. Failed to lead it so sad, layback first 30ft pumped out. Toprope with pasha \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. quite the adventure of sizes and techniques. fun and funky climbing \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. all my dreams were crushed in the first 30 feet of flailing but made sense of the rest but still felt hard. surprised to do it clean on a second TR lap. still don't think it's a 10+ \u00b7 Lead. Best route on the cliff. Cruxes are thin, not wide. Save a #1 for after the first roof. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Roof is deceivingly tight.. (#1s) I\u2019d say 6 #1s is a minimum for people with larger hands. Sandbagged for sure An amazing climb though! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Felt hard for the grade very sustained with 1 C4s and some 2s \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. siiiiiick, waited way too long to come back! last day of the trip. It took everything I had, and I'm not sure how I didn't peel off either of the thin hand sections..75 (back clean), .4, .75 in bottom of first flare, .4 high in flare, .5 z4 (tight just after flare, bumped as I moved up.) #4 in wide bit above chockstone, 3-4 #1s in thin hands, bumped and back cleaned one, placed #2. no hands rest at base of flare(moves some gear to right side to get my left side) ..was able to climb more straight in on TR. #2 in 2nd flare, bumped a ways. #3 at top of flare(?). placed #4 in wide bit, but it was t necessary, other options were available. a couple #1s, couple #2s, and couple #3s (one of the threes under the second roof (extended). .. with bumping, a couple back cleans and climbing above gear further to get through a couple sections, the gear was spaced more than typical for me. \u00b7 Follow. Followed clean, awesome and varied route. Favorite of the day! Crux was exiting the wide section on finger locks. Pulling the roof sections on hands/tight hands was sweet. Stemming was cool, with spooky exposure \u00b7 TR. aaahhhh so good and varied. I chimnied the roof to achieve hands section up top \u00b7 TR. Made it to the chains, but with many falls after the first roof when the crack got too skinny for my thumb meat and too wide for good ringlocks. Right on my physical limit, even on TR. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. .3, .4, .5(x2), .75, 1 (x6-7), 2(x7), 3(x3), 4, three slings. Left shoulder pro.Wes, Molly, Patrick. Hung on fingers, sent the rest! Save WC #1s through roof instead of overcammed 2. 1's and 2's after the roof. Save 3+4 for pod. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Mostly mental blocks and not having enough number ones. Really enjoyable with every style. Would be fun to try to do clean, but definitely pushed my limit today. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 hang at roof, put #1 in the widest jam ... \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Amazing varied crack climbing with awesome positioning. Went to the limit pulling through the second roof. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 2x .3, 3x .5, 2x .75s, 6x 1s, 4x 2s, 2x 3s, 1x4 (pod/ backclean + bring to top) - high step layback pod \u00b7 TR. TR\u2019ed it after Brett. Sweet climb, and got two super stuck 1s out by stacking one nut tool on the other through the wrench hole and then pulled \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Woooow fun. A lot of work. Forgot a #4.. would have been nice for low pod \u00b7 TR. so many falls. climbed second day in the creek. it would be interesting to try again on next visit! \u00b7 Lead / Flash. One hand jam was assisted by #2 cam.. but oh well. Super fun.. super pumpy \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Yikers this was harder than any other 10+ or 11- I have done in the creek. \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Major struggle fest on lead, 1.5 hours. Not ready for this! 0.5 off-fingers at the beginning was the hardest. On TR lap after lead, fell twice on fingers and hung once below second bulge. \u00b7 TR. One fall on fingers after wide section. Clean through roofs\u2026 fuck it was burly \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. This thing\u2019s awesome! Really long with some awkward wide sections in the beginning with fingers in the back. The hands roofs were incredible. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. .4 x2 .5 1 x5 (could bring 6-7 and one less 2) - Mount 1st pedestal - Mount 2nd: left tight hand jam, rock on right knee, step up (back clean .4 if placed) - .4\u2019s, good locks and ow feet - Good lock over small roof, .5\u2019s - Good locks to chock stone \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 2 hung again: rack in order: .4, .4, .4, .5, .75, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 1, 2, 2, 4 \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Working those thin hands! Fell once, pumped out after the big roof \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Really good. Blew a foot at the end of the .75 section. Full value climb \u00b7 Lead. Took down low on account of not having enough .3 for the fingers. Sent up high. Crazy! realllllly great route. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. insane climb. so fucking good. probably one of my favorite single pitch crack climbs. varied and long with beautiful movement and climbing. all the stars. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. w/ Zoe, Cydney/Kahlan, Emily/Otto, Sam/Maddie. felt hard on finger, OW, and tight hands sections. flailed like crazy and need to work those sizes. should have extended some pieces. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Took during .5 fingers section / fell once on 1s roof \u2014 need to focus on feet \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard! Bring extra #2s and #1s for the roof \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fall at second roof .3-3 super fun stemy moves at first roof \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. slight epic... thought we were on a different climb and ran out of gear halfway up. pulled gear up and did not hang. felt way hard! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. pretty tough maybe 11-. thin hands and stem. cams walk. lost 2 yellows at crux..use reds \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Left my BD#1 :( Take at roof, otherwise clean send. Crux roof is loose #1 \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. One pull on gear and hang just before I fell pulling the second roof. I was so pumped! Super fun and varied climb! I felt like I had to fight right from the start. \u00b7 Lead. 1's at the top. Save 2's maybe another 3? Doubles with most everything else. \u00b7 Follow. Clean follow. A little bit of everything from finger jams to thin hands to hand stacks to chimneying. Long and physical the whole way \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. No Gimme. A little bit of everything.. Fingers to OW to chimney."

This way is pretty claustrophobic, so unless you weigh less than about 120 pounds I wouldn't recommend it! It's probably better to lieback this wide section.  A rest is available after coming out of the chimney, and is followed by another offwidth section that's 5 or 6 inches wide.

Can\u2019t get bigger tho or else I won\u2019t fit in squeeze :( \u00b7 TR. First off width ever!! So funny haha. Got helmet stuck in first crack and had to bop through. Laybacked first entire section - could theoretically layback top as well? Good opportunity to practice off width technique w both feet though \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. First 5.11 OW, and third OW lead 5.10 and up. Super psyched! I\u2019m just shy of 200lb and was able to make it through the squeeze somewhat comfortably. I could imagine someone slightly larger than me still making it through but it would be tight\u2026 \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. RP 17 SEP 2024 1x 1-3 2x 5-6 Lead F/H 11 OCT 2021 TR 26 SEP 2021 \u00b7 TR. Need a lot of energy, was able to get thru the squeeze but you need to take helmet off \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Fun route. Barely made it through the squeeze. The 6s section was actually pretty cruiser. I went for the jug at the end, but should have just stayed in the crack; it would have been easier overall. \u00b7 TR. Last route (#20) at Crack Camp. Deb led - she's a beast! I made it most of the way up thru the first squeeze and gave up. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. w/ David. DNF. Had to down lead when I couldn\u2019t fit through the chimney\u2026 \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Awesome line! Only need 1x #5 and 2x #6 to feel comfy \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Bring two 6s next time or bring a 6 and 7 \u00b7 TR. Grunted my way up this. Actually super fun to get to top rope it. Tried to squeeze thru the first wide section, ended up out on the face with cool crimp and mantle moves. Fist stacking and zero feet form work well enough on TR! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Did not finish. After attempting to fit through squeeze and to go around for like an hour, the folks I borrowed two 6's from called them back. Aid downclimbed. \u00b7 TR. cheated past the birth canal but otherwise a clean toprope first go...felt very comfortable on the wide part up top \u00b7 TR. i was scared of squeeze chimney...stayed out if it. i tried and tried again but kept backing off once my chest got tight for fear my hips would not fit through... worked the ow at the top and it felt pretty ok! \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. FUCK YEAAA first section felt so good with mythos. I committed to the overhanging offwidth till I stepped on a good jug \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. So close to onsight . Spooked by bumping one six and didn\u2019t wanna fall on it. Ramy s beta is to the jug left foot on on the ripple on the left and knee bar grab whatever you can do pull it. I kept scooching up the overhanging arm bar. The squeeze was tight I thought I was gonna throw up. Five and four was useless. Just few sixes \u00b7 TR. Struggle on the first bit (laybacked). Couldn't fuck with the offwidth top either. Need to horizontal karate kick inside deep then heel-toe jam in the R and push up with it with a chicken wing/arm bar. Apparently. \u00b7 TR. couldn't make it through the low squeeze - 0/4 Dan Noah Alex me there \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Could NOT fit through the squeeze. Ended up pulling through on the outside. Redlined on the straightforward OW above and took a lot. Thanks to the Norwegians for the extra #6. \u00b7 TR. made it to the top! with glen, devin, phil, orion, marco, & angelina \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Got sidewinder beta from Mary Eden when I got my butt stuck in the squeeze. \u00b7 TR. Fit through the slot then fell starting the offwidth. Used fist stacks to work my way up. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. led with Mary, first bulge is Crux. use crimps/layback to get knee bars \u00b7 biffed it twice down low not using the obvious feet out left. sent it after always cruising the 6's and 9's \u00b7 TR. Good practice. Top was so hard for me. 6 is an awkward size, can\u2019t really get a knee jam \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Gear (c4) 2, 3, 5, 6 (2) L side in LB start (.75 to 1 to 2 crack) Steep finish \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at the crux at the very top overhanging #6 section. Didn\u2019t get good rest and was running out of gas. I did flash the lower section all the way up until that point. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Crux was moving all my gear out of the way in the squeeze. I plugged my 5\u2019s and 6\u2019s then hung my #10 Fun! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Fun! Squeeze was crazy tight! Nearly botched the upper section with indecisiveness but managed to pull it together after going to the rail for a rest (At) \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung in the thin down low once and then a few times when it got wider than a 6. Bailed just shy of the chains. Sim finished it by aiding. \u00b7 TR. Fell at the top crux again. Too big for my heel toe. But I fit fine in the squeeze. \u00b7 TR. Bailed on squeeze. Matt fit, I knew I could, but so damn tight. Upper OW sooooooo fun. Sent that part :) save some juice for top.. gets sandy/awkward \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. This one had me more nauseous than Belly Full Of Bad Berries. Too much binging. \u00b7 onsight. I am a fairly big guy and I fit through the squeeze. Left shoulder in. \u00b7 Really humorous, but if this were in Yosemite it would be 10a, 10b tops."

Lots of feet and some crimps too for the occasional crack climbers like myself. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. If you\u2019re doing twin cracks, just shoot up to the top anchors. Way worth it. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Used a #6, two #4, two #3, one #2. Beautiful route. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Solid climb need a standard rack and 2 #2\u2019s atleast 1 #4 (two would be ideal) and 2 #3\u2019s ( 1 of them for the top) First pitch: jugs on the right side. Second pitch: To pull the flake shift weight center and pull the finger crack with both hands. Top section hand and foot Jam crack on the right and pull the left hand on flake. \u00b7 TR. Did this on TR after Twin Cracks. Nathan lead it! Funky after the Twin Cracks anchor with the flaky thing but super fun. Feeling better every climb \u00b7 TR. Good fun. Can either lay back the flake, off width the flake, or off width to big hands on the crack to the right. Either way the best pro is probably in the crack tot he right. Bunch of #4's if my memory is correct. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. fun fun fun! a little scary! #6 placement is poopy pants - maybe just don\u2019t bring it. cool ow. coool \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Was nice to have 6 for this. Linked the climb with the one below. Left draws up all day until jack went up later. \u00b7 Follow. Loved this climb on follow. There's many ways to approach it. Link and I both stemmed feet quite far and found occasional hand jams and foot jams to get off the deck. The flake becomes a bomber jug lay back which you can take to the top to either finish on face or in crack. I choose face for obvious reasons. Really great climb but a little hard to protect! Link placed big cames 4s and a 5 \u00b7 Lead / Flash. atypical for IC- the giant flake is solid and give v wide cracks- lots of layback up to good feet \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Sport climb. Stem right wall. Start off p2 is a bit nervous. Two #4s 1 #5. May be able to get away with 3#4s \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. \u05db\u05de\u05d5 \u05e1\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d8 \u05e2\u05dc \u05d0\u05e8\u05e8\u05d8 \u05e2\u05dd \u05dc\u05d9\u05d9\u05d1\u05e7, \u05d4\u05e7\u05e4\u05e6\u05ea\u05d9 \u05de\u05e1\u05e4\u05e8 4 \u05d1\u05de\u05e9\u05da \u05db\u05dc \u05d4\u05d7\u05dc\u05e7 \u05d4\u05d0\u05d7\u05e8\u05d5\u05df, \u05d4\u05d9\u05d4 \u05e0\u05d7\u05de\u05d3 \u00b7 Lead / Flash. OW was a bit burly. Went to the right of the flake, idk if that\u2019s right \u00b7 Follow. heady lead but good pro. one #5, two #4, two #3s at the top, one #1 middle section. use the flake and hook a knee behind it to start \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Fun flake and liebacking! A little heady start to get to the first gear placement, but super fun! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Good old fashion fun, super unique feature, real fun to climb. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Messed around with the offwidth move for a bit but it\u2019s pretty easy once you know how \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. bring a #6 or at least a #5 if you want to eliminate decking potential as you climb above the twin crack anchors. \u00b7 TR. Woops. May have sandbagged George by sending him up this with only 1 4. Dood crushed it. Super fun messing with the flake \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. lost every style point I've ever earned by taking/hauling on gear through the offwidth, then laybacking... but made it to the top!!!! \u00b7 TR. Great climb, but careful so the bongo flake doesn't bongo onto your belayer \u00b7 I loved this!!!! Brought 2 #4s and it felt safe. So fun!

Hard cranking right hand thumbs down left hand thumbs up with some dicey stemming \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Wicked! Got tunnel vision and punted right when it eased up. Bomber .3s and .2s. Whole thing climbs like a dream. \u00b7 TR. Could be doable\u2026 bottom is stem, tips crack and the rest is cake \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. got all the moves fell 4 times in the stem section \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. many hangs through the fingy section. wasn't stoked on the loose bolts at the anchor. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Nur F Richtig cool. Hart und gut gek\u00e4mpft, und am Ende Erfolg gehabt. 2 Offset Tips Risse (bomben 0.3er), die man zum Gl\u00fcck gegeneinander ausspreitzen kann. Der linke springt aber nur 1,5 cm vor. Stehen ist also trotzdem schmierig. Oben cooles rauscruisen durch Handriss und 2 m gutm\u00fctigen offwidth. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Maybe one of my favorite single pitches of all time. Seems like this routes doesn't get done often, but I think it stood out to me as one if my favorite pitches in the creek. Such amazing crack movement with really cool stems out right. And varied sizes after the initial .3 section! ALL TIME! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Stemming and big reaches! Next time, bring a 4 for the top and maybe 3 2s/3s \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Quiet a few whips low, pulled all the moves except 1 and flowed then groveled to the top. Very exciting!! Will be back to send! \u00b7 TR. perfect tight fingers and smaller with pods. above is perfect hands-4+ to the anchors so sicm \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. difficult, need to commit harder to odd body position with my feet. don't blow all your holds but one bomber finger lock \u00b7 TR. Tight TR down low in finger stem section with a couple foot slips. clean after that. \u00b7 TR. Top rope through stemming finger cracks (struggle bus), lead to the top (1 hang)"

A king line featuring unlikely face climbing which leads into a slowly widening crack starting as tips and finishing with 20 feet of 511- OW climbing guarding the anchor. We weren\u2019t initially prepared to do battle with this line. But Jason had the ball nuts, Chad had some pins and hooks in his truck, Pat had the bolts and a neighboring party had a #5 which they loaned us. Bolts 2-5 were drilled on lead using aid tactics and the 1st and 6th were added once free climbing sequences were sorted out.The name Creeksmythe references the art of doing ground-up new-age routes in Indian Creek but is also a subtle reference to my good friend Nolan Smythe who passed away last year. He always preferred the new-age Creek routes and I\u2019m certain this would have been one of his favorites.Please respect the sandstone and don\u2019t climb this route after rain.

Fell a few times in locks, lay backing is not always a bad thing! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. don\u2019t believe the fear mongering. Made it most of the way up but very tired. Critical piece is blue totem seated nicely in between lower constrictions. Used all .4 and .5 before that. Honestly without the blue totem you\u2019d still be fine \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. I took at the midway point to get more .5s. I only took 3, thought it was .4s! Whoops.. then fell at the top botching a placement and pumped out. Classic \u00b7 TR. This shit was so hard. Could not get the top out move for the life of me. The rest is just a suffer fest sustained lie-back that is all doable, just pumpy. Potter led, took a butt ton of 0.5s \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Felt really good this year. Didn\u2019t remember my top beta but technique improved enough to not need it \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Took and fell quite a bit, but fun and fairly easy to protect (except at the top.. used a 0.3-0.5, sometimes only half the lobes in bc the crack gets very shallow\u2026definitely bring micros next time. Used a lot of ring locks and climbed it mostly straight on with to occasional lie backing. I only brought down to 0.3 but could\u2019ve used at least one 0.2). The top felt harder, but I also had a lot of gear above me which limited my hands. Take doubles 0.2-0.4, 7 #0.5s, a 0.75 and a 1 or ocean pacific .75/1 ideally to sew it up \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 4x.5 6x.4 8x.3 4x.2 1x.75 1x1. Save #1 for clipping the chains..2s for aiding the top. Mainly .3 and .4 \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Piece to piece lead. Whipped at the top and popped a 0.2 woohoo. 2nd lap clean on TR \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. The trick for me was to be really pumped and then place bad gear at the top to be incentivized not to fall \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Hell yeah, been scared of this one for years. Taking the flash for all the MP beta. Was nervous but was not too hard tbh, good endurance bangs. Good rests then fire the end. Mantle is the crux until I found the high fingerlock by the chains. Glad I didn\u2019t fall. \u00b7 TR. Fell at the top then used the crimp on the right and made it up \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at the final sequence. Hard crimpy mantle nonsense. I think the climbing is some of the best I\u2019ve ever done. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Took a big ol whip off the lip on my os attempt. Will be back! .4 .5 .4 .5 .4 .4 .3 .3 .5 .3 \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Felt decent on climbing. Gear took some time to figure out. Bring black totem for top next time. And more .5s \u00b7 TR. Top roped ducking hard crux is the last move which you won\u2019t have energy for good luck trying to lead this layback powerhouse don\u2019t lose a finger. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Made it to the crux before taking a whip onto a good .4! Didn't figure it out the first couple goes but figured it out with the key right alpine knee. This is probably the most beat up crack I've seen in the creek, so 3 stars not 4. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Scary mantel move to the chains. Busted a wire on my blue totem. Bummer. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. tombe avant le crux final car les doigts se coincent alors que je suis en dulf. un peu stressant. crux final: un dernier totem cam noir \u00e0 la sortie. main gauche dessous. main droite \u00e9paule plate, remonte main gauche coincement de doigts sur la premi\u00e8re prise au dessus du totem. main droite dans la bonne au dessus en ring locks. pied gauche vient juste sous le totem, \u00e9crase ton poids dessus, d\u00e9ploie et viens coincer la main sur la derni\u00e8re prise tout en haut. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Took near top due to a cam that wouldn\u2019t actuate.. Will send soon. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 hang, fell at bulge out of finger pods before hand jam top, protect bulge with 0.3s in the crack not 0.4 in the pod \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at the crux, then TRd for a lap Key black totem Hand beta high right hand \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 5 feet from on sighting. Got a tipped out blue totem in before the crux and slipped going for the good finger lock over the mantle. \u00b7 TR. hold on the left face high up on the feature allows for a shake before pulling the final mantle \u00b7 TR. felt good on top rope, cant imagine sending on lead. top mantle was cruxy \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. finally redpoint after 5 years haha. as the warmup for the day. crack definitely seems more beat out. good placements can be had at the cost of pump. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. A fall down low, and one fall before chains. Kinda tricky finish when pumped! \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. A headier creek lead. Falling into the dihedral isn\u2019t super fun. Worked out gear and moves with Grant \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Nur F Geil. Im oberen Teil kann man erstaunlich gut stehen (vermutlich ausgetretenen scars). Die Crux ganz oben ist d\u00fcnn und garstig und ich hatte Angst um meinen neuen 0.3er cam. Der mantle an einem wackeligen Tips-klemmer war also spannend, aber ich habs durchziehen k\u00f6nnen :) \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Fell once near the bottom trying to clip followed by a semi-deck. Thankfully, my belayer did her job and kept me mostly off the ground with no injuries on either of our part. Sent the second try. The top was awkward but fun and challenging. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Yoyo'd *did the first 1/4 on tr after marina bailed. Finished the lead clean \u00b7 TR. Lay backed to the top, final two moves were very hard. Got the feet out right. \u00b7 TR. more straight in, then got desperate, then rest and bad technique up top. Left foot in a pod is key to the top move, and the right foot before that needs to be nice \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. five .4 & .5 one 1 two or three .3. top is definitely the crux and pretty blown out maybe just run it out on send go. two hang in the same spot before the mantel \u00b7 TR. Tommy led. I had a hard time on this. difficult thin linebacking with feet slipping quite a bit. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Ass whooped. Mainly #0.5, 0.4, and 0.3 at the very top \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Slipped off rest and hung up rest. At top get right hand over lip, then deep left, then stand up on left foot. \u00b7 TR. w/ Sean. TR flash not needing to clean gear and did a full layback sprint just for kicks. \u00b7 TR. Super fun lie back. Would have been very hard on lead. Guy who set it up used 10 .4\u2019s and a few others \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. took a lead fall on a .4 from the finishing crux. good 15 footer. gear is good \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Still hard! Did not read my notes so didn\u2019t bring that offset. A few offsets might be really helpful. \u00b7 This route was literally covered in blood not so confidence inspiring.... but normal fo get crack with lumpy beginning 11a \u00b7 TR. Belayed evan on this and got to too rope lieback it. Bottom feels doable, top section was tough. Tricky last moves \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Took a bunch of whips trying to figure out the crux. Way too worked to get it, had to pull on gear \u00b7 TR. One move then shoulder shifted and hurt a ton so finish that idea...all lay backs till the top \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Clean to 10 feet below anchors. Crux is getting into the pod at the top. Tricky to protect (just wigged out and took, and then sent np) \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard!!! Especially at the top. A .4/.5 offset might protect the top. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell near the top, worried about gear pulling after reading mp comments. No need to! Small but solid gear, crux was making the last few moves with the pump \u00b7 TR. One hung at crux pulling into the belay; would be very hard to lead \u00b7 TR. didn't climb but Troutman and I fiddled with the first few moves without rope (just before the trip was when the guy left a couple knuckles in the wall)"

Tight hands for 15ft, then undulates between perfect hands and awkward wide pods. Twin crack finish is funky and pumpy. With Doug, Ben and Noah. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Just enough wide hands to be sustained! Bring fingers for the top \u00b7 Lead. Great route with some variety! Mix of 2s and 3s and a 4 and 5 would be nice, .5 and .3 for the top \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Rad. 10+ suggestion due to two #4 pods and the long nature. 7 3s, 3 2s, 2 4s, few .5-.75 \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Completed\u2026took 5-6 times\u2026.ran out of gear and had to lower back down to get more. Embarassing \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell in the long 2.5 section after second wide pod. still felt hard! still ate tons of gear \u00b7 TR. Not fun if you have small hands. A couple good hands but never tight. Lots of bigger than cupped but smaller than fists, also some just bigger than fists. \u00b7 TR. W Nate, Donovan kauri etc. Started in the finger crack, changed to gorilla after falling out when it pinched to tips. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung a few times, got intimidated by the pods Rack: 1 red metolius, 1x .75x 2-3x 1.0, 4x 2.0, 6x 3.0, 2x 4.0 (smaller sizes would work for the left crack too .4-.75) \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Led this with some takes. Have rock burn on my right arm from it. Burly pods, fun top out \u00b7 TR. Swung between this and 11 next door. DNF. Too much offwidth for me! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Almost as good as 3AM. More varied with pods, and eventually meets up with pringles. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Really digging meaty hand climbs lately as someone with small hands lol \u00b7 TR. wanted to quit crack climbing at the second OW pod but decided I had fun by the time I got back to the ground \u00b7 TR. Used the lie-back to the left to skip the second pod and pulled on #3s for the second half. No point of this route felt fun \u00b7 Lead. 1st pod was physical. Off hands after was cruxy. Then cruising fun jams and stems! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Feet popped at one point. Definitely felt that I haven\u2019t climbed outside in 2 months! Toe blister hurt and bailed on the climbs I really wanted to try\u2026 oh well still fun!! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Really wanted one more climb before we left so I sent this with a headlamp on! Tricky climbing such smooth and sustained wide hands. Crux was definitely manteling into those offwidth pods. Once again good footwork prevailed. Ended up bumping my #3s a long way up the bottom section, whoever writes these rack descriptions must be stronger than I! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Did it in two. Took at a part with hands where I was just before the good stemming \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Blew the clip on the third cam and took a ground fall. Broke finger and maybe foot. \u00b7 Lead. very tiring. took a lot down low. clean after meeting the left crack. \u00b7 Lead. Hung at the second offwidth, hard to commit to a tipped out 4. \u00b7 TR. Fun! But hard in the pods for someone who doesn\u2019t have good off width technique \u00b7 Lead / Flash. My favorite route on the supercrack buttress so far! Sustained #3s, with some cruxy wide moves to gain large pods twice on the route. Not a good warmup, but not super hard either. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Lisa\u2026 bring #3s lol\u2026 lead this with only two 3s. Bumped them a long ways. Really fun. Felt more burly and heady with the runout \u00b7 TR. One of the harder 5.10s for smaller hands. A battle where you find your self yarding on #3 sized cracks, never good \u00b7 Lead. 1 .75, 1.5, about 4 1\u2019s, 6 2\u2019s, 5 3\u2019s, 3.5, 3 4\u2019s \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Near the top anchor rope got stuck, fixed line, rappeled on munterhitch, jugged rope, retied and finished. Came down amy couldnt get off the ground, reclimbed free and clean on TR. excellent route. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Very fun and varied climbing, especially with the double cracks up top. Should have brought more 3s. Ideal rack would be 1x 0.5, 3x 0.75, 4x #1, 2x #2, 5x #3, 2x #4 \u00b7 TR. Josh put up. fun but hard section of 4s in the middle. didn't get it clean. burly route in general \u00b7 TR. Loved this climb, just did it on TR because I was spent and it was hot. Next time, lead \u00b7 TR. Not my style. Many 3s and manufacturing into the OW pods was burly \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Ahhh could\u2019ve onsightef it but no rest after cleaning the crack right of it. Four blues four yellow two purple two gray and two gray and two one. Mostly cupped hands wear gloves next time \u00b7 Follow. Top was tough today\u2026 awkward but all there\u2026 makes me more happy about onsight in 2021 \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Tricky in the bulge place can right below and trust it. Hard finger start, weird pod and then perfect to the top \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Two broken trigger wires, the knee blew out of my pants, and Daniel broke another shoe lace. 2x .5-#1, 6 #2, 6 #3, 1-2 #4 (definitely one for first pod.)"

Kinda proud to have sent this on top-rope. Had to go pretty deep for the hand jams at the roof, and a little hard to keep the hands in order. Super cruiser afterwards. Coolest climb yet. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Don\u2019t waste energy placing too much gear on overhang 3 pieces will be plenty. There is a great rest after OH. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Took me three go. First go was kind of intimidated of the roof and fucked up immediately got back on it and was just a little too pumped. Came back a couple days later and got it clean. \u00b7 TR. Only could do half, before the slope part. Waited 2 hours for sun to hit it \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Gave the lead a go couldn\u2019t get pass the over hanging crack, took a couple whips up there first time leading a climb I didn\u2019t think I could finish which was kinda cool to be trying hard mentally until next time I suppose \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 1h this time. Felt haarrd through the roof. And pumpy.. bring lots of 2s. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 1, 3, run out to a 2 at the ledge, wild country 2 extended, wild country 2 extended, assortment from 1-3 at the top. 1ea of 1,3 for top \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Swim up the overhang, don\u2019t try to cross arms. Heavy on 2 bring 3 1s and 2 3s \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. placed a high 3 in the roof. jammed past it then reaching for high jam slipped out. immediately got back on and jammed to the chains. high 3 to start, 6 2s with some runouts and 3 in the roof. no so incredible 3am was better \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Found this much more fun than Supercrack, though a shame it\u2019s so blown out at the crux. Only placed three #2s and a #3 on the whole route. Happy to bag this classic \u00b7 Follow. Them baggy 3s thru da crux. Josh led this since I don't really need to lead it again. Becca topped as well. \u00b7 TR. This felt so hard. Watching Rachel do it: right hand high, left hand lower, just shuffle them. Same with the feet: right foot high, left foot low, shuffle. I didn\u2019t get to the top even, !!!! \u00b7 TR. Excellent route! Definitely had to think at the wide flaring part right before the end of the overhanging roof part. It was so rad starting the roof section and I loved plugging away the hands! Top section was also fantastic after getting a nice rest in between. Definitely got quite light headed as that was our warmup\u2026 \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Came back a year later and sent it after failing to clear the roof the first time. Feels good. \u00b7 TR. With Jake. Made it to the start of the overhand roof section, last climb of the day and we were short on sunlight. Would need fresh arms to even TR it. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. With Kayla + Blaine, Jack and Andy. Roof was tough for me. Had to really reach in for a good jam. Hung a couple times. Below and above was cruiser. \u00b7 TR. This crack is rad! There\u2019s a 5 foot section at the beginning of the bulge that was really hard for me and I jugged through on the top rope The rest of it has some hard sections but is very doable ~ just gotta get my hands and feet in deep and keep it tight. Glorious when you get above the bulge! Good sit rest and then fun climbing to the top When I was getting lowered I stopped and got back on the section I jugged and I was able to pull the moves I had to really stick my feet in there and hold my core tight and scum my right side on the wall and just inch my way up bumping my hands and feet , not crossing anything, with my arms like almost elbow deep. It was really hard but I was able to get good enough jams to place gear. I would lead this on a high energy day! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Lived up to the name. It really is a whole route that\u2019s perfectly in my hand size! Crux was pulling the bulge. Would\u2019ve been easy to sandbag yourself by trapping yourself with your own reach, and keeping the feet in is tricky. Everything else is buttery goodness! Placed a navy blue tricam to supplement all the #2s \u00b7 TR. Followed Esteban. Fell twice at the overhang, need to work on the jam technique. Beautiful crack above and below the overhang. Good rests above the overhang. \u00b7 Lead. Fell one and took once then got it. Best crack I've ever done \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to aid moves of the roof, couldn't figure out how to push with my feet \u00b7 Lead. Many 1, at least four 2, couple of 3 \u2026 also .75 and .5 Cruz is bulge out move with right hand and get feet in and high. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Pretty sick roof crack, 2s in 2s on 2s. So sick \u00b7 TR. Inverted it for funsies. Crazy how hard inverting non roof cracks are hahahah. With Simon! His second crack climb \u00b7 TR. Fell a few times during roof. Solid 2s that felt really hard to jam \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Felt so good this time! Thicker crack gloves helped. used 7 2s \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Yoinks. First clip placement fall here. Not super bueno - slippery start. The #2 @ second part of ramp is biggest #2 you\u2019ll get - keep pushing through next time. Ended up lowering off of that guy & TRing later - but could def lead up to crux. Overhanging crux is tricky w deep #3s - hard to pull. \u00b7 TR. Flash on TR. Super fun. Broken up by good rests. Makes you earn it. \u00b7 Lead. Such an incredible route. With NREL Milk the corner rest then go for it. All #2 & 3. I took a brief rest but not needed. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. such an amazing route, and feels mega on lead. proper whipped out of the overhang and psyched about it! with akhil. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Hands hands hands! Jamming felt good, though slightly wide at the bulge for me. (Wide 2s) \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Flash. Flashed and then yo-yo\u2019d when Tyler broke his toe. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. w/Tom - really nice pitch - 3 hang - fall at the crux - and then took above after pumping out - redpointable with a few runs and working out technique - super fun in any case \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Really fun last route of the trip. Felt much more cruiser than last time! Thanks to a great trip with Stew and Ethan \u00b7 Follow. So fucking sweet!!!!! I couldn\u2019t get past the one pod on the roof but other than that I pretty much cruised. I think that was the only spot i took \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. You want a lot of 2\u2019s. I had 6 and was running the top out on tipped out 1\u2019s \u00b7 TR. Only did first two parts to size 3 overhand and pooped out. Left blood on wall to the crag gods. \u00b7 Fell, maybe a number two in the roof is better? Don\u2019t put a cam in your way? Or just beef up \u00b7 TR. Couldn\u2019t get a good jam or good feet on the roof. Pulled past. After the roof was easy. Before the roof was a little tough with a wide section at the first ledge that I fell on. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Clean. Good rests before pulling roof move. Went up, placed gear and came back to rest more. Felt scary at initial steep part \"idk about this\" I said, but pulled the move and it didnt feel that hard. Gunned thru the overhang. Great many rests up top. Careful with extending gear, people jam in cams. Bring 4+ slings. Placed a few 2s and few 3s. With sarah. Would do again. ---- \u00b7 TR. Such a fun climb! Perfect hand jams! Fell at crux twice before sending. \u00b7 Lead. W/Tali. Of course it's good, but it's not anything \"out of this world\" \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Sweaty sunny power lap. Also, Kalous is the man lmao. Shared the crag w some legends today."

Half way until the changing corner from left to right...one knuckle lock and then smear feet and move around the corner...couldn\u2019t quite hold the lock off \u00b7 TR. Crack school; Coleman sent it. MB and Cristian got partway up. I bailed very early. Last climb of 3 days...exhausted and tore up 1 knuckle and said enough \u00b7 Lead / Onsight.

Fun challenge, eldo like start, good cupped hands mostly after to .75s \u00b7 Follow. Wide section felt hard, I used both cracks in the fingers section, but apparently if leading you want to try to stay in right side \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Super fun and varied\u2026 Jackie with the belay. Favorite route of the day. Cam, Alicia, and Frits hanging \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. A fun varied crack; neat lieback into splitter into crack switch \u00b7 TR. Loved this climb. Took once coming out of the pod, then once at the crack switch. I think I could get this clean. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Ok I\u2019ve decided that I really like this climb. Good rests, great variety. Just get through the sporty/pumpy beginning. 2 .4 and the gray alien were nice. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Got super in my head, tricky bouldery start then wide 3s (tight 4). Fun interesting climb. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Julian\u2026 super fun climbing! Goes through so many sizes! .4 - #4 techniques and cool crack transfers. Classic! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Really cool! Lots of variety in the moves! Starts thin goes big and then pinches down again! Loved it! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Biggest whipper of my life 15\u2019, and first fall on gear :) thanks Sage for the great catch. \u00b7 TR. 28!! struggle bus. Ella put it up, and John TRed. last climb of the day. first day back and 28 pitches. 4 leads, 8 TR solos, and many belays from Ella, John, and strangers. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Date approx. Trip with Nacho. Lots of styles on a super fun climb. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Double 3 and 4 camalot, triple 4 and double 3 May be best through wide section. Upper bit is .5-#1 camalot \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Messed up intro sequence and took the harder lieback instead of fantastic face holds. Fell to the deck saved by Ivan \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Done with Trevor. 1st climb in the Creek! Got some advice from a stranger that said it was easy. Little did I know that it was going to be the hardest trad lead I have done yet. Really thin bouldery moves to fists and lay backs. My endurance ran out 2/3 of the way up and had to let Trevor finish it. Such a cool climb. \u00b7 TR. Done with Trevor. Managed to lap it clean without a take. Definetly felt tired after it. Will come back and get this clean! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. This was a bit tricky and heady. I dyno'd above some blue totems to reach the ledge at the start of the hand crack. After you move out of the hand crack it's tricky. Gear: .3-.5 for start, 4s, 3s, 2s, and a 1 for the hand crack, then 1, .75, .5 for the crack at the end. \u00b7 TR. Varied climbing and sustained, but there are a few rests. Would be a very challenging lead for me - heady. I kinda liked the short wide section midway up \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Led with Lindsay and Hallie - tricky lower half, strenuous getting out of pod. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. I thought this climb was awesome! I enjoyed it more than anything else I climbed today. (Gorilla, Wave) \u00b7 TR. TR no takes, super awesome climb that is great for starting trad because it has a huge variety of crack size \u00b7 TR. very good top rope. would not be able to lead the #3 section. bigger than fists. \u00b7 TR. Tronsight. Back to being a top rope tough guy after re-injuring my foot on Coyne\u2026 (w/ sprained ankle) \u00b7 TR. very fun because of the varied sizes and face features to work with, go for lead. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. lead bottom 1/3 to OW Kirk tagged in for middle 1/3 tagged back in for top 1/3 \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Felt like 10+ It\u2019s more 3s than 2s Take a 4 \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Awesome line with a lot of variety, finger crack, fist and hand \u00b7 TR. first IC climb. was super excited. hung once. super pumped in hand crack section. had some face features to use. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Lol after 5 days in the creek the beginning felt stout. Took on .5. Placed 2 4s and the 3.5. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. just a TR, but would be fun to return for the lead \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Aided thru the bottom fingers, got spooked by the flake/rock quality. sent from that point, cool route \u00b7 fun to return. lead w/ natalie. Good route with nice variety of sizes and movement. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. FUNKY! Off fingers, off width, and off hands but good pro. doubles .3-4 plus 4 .75s and .3. could fit a 5 too."

I really enjoyed the climbing, so hopefully others will too.The name is a spoof on the International Affair theme, and a tip of the hat to the Bill Murray movie. It's also kind of a jab at myself, seeing as how I added this route right in the middle of everything at Supercrack Buttress. Interpret it how you will. I drilled all three protection bolts and the anchor on lead, from the ground up. Although it's short, it packs some engaging climbing like its neighbor.Delicate and powerful climbing with tiny gear brings you to a stance at the first bolt. From there, wild chimneying and stemming, and one more bouldery sequence lead to the anchor.",

Baggy fists/butterfly, all 3s and 2s pretty much. Use face holds for right feet when you can. Becomes perfect hands at the very top \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Several hang up high. Save 2 4s, 2 3s, 2 2s and a 1 for the last quarter. Mostly more 3s for first half \u00b7 TR. Ran up this in like literally 2 min on top rope. Moving one hand and one foot at the same time. Paused shortly in the 4 section \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Climbed with Simon and elo. 3 3s, 2,4,2,1 pro. Bumped a lotttt. Super consistent but has a couple different types of size in it. Long and good! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Sustained 3s for the first half is cruiser. Could make a fun project. Stem at the top. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. 2x 4s for the start and one more 4 on the wall. Heavy 2s and 3s, 1x 1. \u00b7 TR. Sick of #3s. Feeling haggard. A few sections felt good, otherwise just really big for me. Erron wanted more than 4 #3s. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. With sarah. Calcite #4 start to top of pillar, then 3s, brought 4, wanted more. Few twos up top and a 4 in a wide challenging section. Bouldery stem topout. Hung to rest to run it out. Fun finger crack on left of pillar to play with as alternative start. Sun by 2 pm ish. \u00b7 Lead. W/Tali. Maybe it's the fatigue of the day, but this shit was physical \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung once at second pod, needed to get deeper hand jam \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. A number of hangs as i got pumped placing gear in the wide crack. Got a clean TR run after. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Trip warmup, endurance is the crux with an exciting stem finish! Fun route \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Sick hands on hands on hands, but like, there's only so much hands that are fun haha \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Right arm was toast. Also didn't take enough #2s - there was more good hands than I expected and should've taken a couple more. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Stellar, one hang. Could use a fifth 2 but four works \u00b7 TR. Awesome day with Brighton, Addy, Amy, Emma. Juni, and Tal. Also a bunch of Amy\u2019s doctor friends (Ryan, Brian, Dave, Paul, Maya, Ophelia, Andres?) \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Sent! Pumpy AF. Was smarter at the 2nd wide section, utilized stem rest, walked #3 high, placed #4 and gunned it. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Pumped out at 2nd wide pod area. Very long and pumpy. Fist Jams and knee scums move feet quick \u00b7 TR. Daniel lead. -Belayed Thomas on this a few years ago after we did 3am and I sarcasticly said \"I think we just climbed this route, I'll pass.\" \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung at fists, no interest in trying hard today \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. At upper 4 section( low left fist and high feet to throw for rt thumbs down), 3 more takes after that; inefficient: gear, rests, footwork, rope in way \u00b7 TR. fell once and pulled in some gear just below the anchor (super pumped by then). don't think I'm at the level to lead it yet, but the top rope felt really good. first ever sustained hand jam - 95% hands, 5% fists. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. got the 4 stuck, hung to remove it! placed 1x #1, 4-5x#2, 3-4x#3, 2x#4. one of the #4s was for the pillar, but another could be used up higher if the fists are scary \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Gassed at the end of the day after north six shooter that morning! Very loose hands for me. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Thin layback start red, green, purple, grey. 6 blues, 4 yellows, 1 red. Great route, pods have a few fist jams, not too many \u00b7 TR. Mock lead on this, felt really good for my first real mock lead crack attempt. I feel like I can do this some day, just need to work on endurance. \u00b7 TR. Wowza. First 40 feet just clicked for the first time. Wow wow fist jams pretty great feet too. This is what I need \u00b7 TR. felt the fun!! i actually like crack climbing. slipped out on some 4 sections. cruiser 2s. grace was fun and supportive as always. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. The #4 section got me. I wanted to take a nap after this lead \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. fun. took all my energy. big to hands. to 3s to red \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. one hang, pumpy! Take (8) #3, (2) #4, a couple #2, one #1 \u00b7 TR. Cupped hands most way up, except for the short wider section (cupped fists). good workout and fun climb ;) \u00b7 TR. w/George, I was soo tired this was such a fight, but got it on tr clean! very sore and happy. lots of variation on this one, but all pretty good jamming, and some rests! looking at it on the way down, it's amazing we climbed a 100'+ corner that's so blank except for the crack... crazy. cool \u00b7 TR. w/George belay, he hauled me up past the wide pod... >__> need to figure out the wide beta.."

I liked a 5 for the beginning but otherwise a double rack of .4-3 would be good \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Got hosed. Felt hard. Took thrice. Wandery. Not straight forward creek climb. Hard 0.75/1 bombay start and corner. Would have to go with confidence, plug and chug. 0.3 to 4 reasonable mostly 1s and 0.75s. With sarah after she got back from SLC and we had some parking lot fun \u00b7 TR. 0.3, 0.4, 3x 0.5, 3 x 0.75, three reds, three yellow, two blue Hot, tr\u2019d but felt more solid that previous \u00b7 TR. Started right, then went left, then back right till the roof. Fun variation I\u2019d say goes at 5.11-? Would be hard to protect on lead. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. used a #5 to protect start, hung 1x in .75 section bout 15ft up, rest went well, super fun! \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Fell at bottom finger crack, then got on it again and sent it clean \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Super fun route! Got scared at the second crack switch. I didn\u2019t need to have a .3 but I placed it when I was pumping out and scared. I think I also brought a 4, can\u2019t remember. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Somehow took huge whip on this as i got cocky and lazy with footwork. Ancient sling held! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Blew off trying to stay left when it turned to tips. Moved right after and pulled it. Fun! \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard start!!! 0.4, 0.5 (2x), 0.75 (3x), orange and black Metolius, 1, 2 (2x), 3 (3x), 4. Many runners and draws. TR lap after \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. .2 (metolius 1), .3, .4, 2 .75, 5 1.0, 2 2.0, 1 3.0, 1 4.0. 1 5.0, 2 slings Whipped high above the blue metolius because I didn\u2019t realize I was supposed to leave the right crack and it got super thin\u2026 but it held and all was dandy! Move back left earlier and it\u2019s perfect hands. Note to self: read route descriptions :) \u00b7 Lead. bottom corner felt very insecure and burly. crack switches and finger section was really fun \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Varied and cool. Great warmup. Almost cruxed out of the thin hands start \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. hung a lot on .75 section. Really tough to place gear on those jams for me. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Got nervous about the.5 section; super chill and clean top rope fitness lap after leading. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. off-finger/thin hands section got me. Need to learn to pull hard on these jams \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. probably would have taken extra .4 & .5. (1).4, (2).75, (2)#1, (2)#2, (2)#3, (1)#4. fun challenging climbing, good variety. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. funky and fun. whenever it starts to feel hard you switch cracks. :) with justing and matt and Clinton and \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Stayed right in the finger crack as long as possible. 11- this way? \u00b7 TR. Should lead! Fun and not just plug and chug. Interesting movement the whole way. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Crux is right after the start in the #.75 section. Do t use jammies! Single piece of tape. Fun with all sizes. Thanks Mia! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. With Jess 1 hang. .4 Bd X2, .5 x 4, .75 X4, #1 X 4, #2, X 3, 2.5\u201d X 1, #3 X 2. 4 QD\u2019s rappell off eye bolt \u00b7 I thought this route was awesome and way fun. Getting off the ground was a awkward with high jams and no obvious feet in the wide crack . I think the crux as stated was the fingers section.

The roof actually is not that tough in comparison to the rest of the climb- just a really sweet undercling-highstep-lieback move.For me, the toughest part of the climb was the LONG thin hands crack that goes from above the roof to the anchors. Very few rests, and continuous green and red camalots... ugh.There are now modern anchors at the top - oversized bolts that you can rappel thru. \u00a0These are at a good stance, a little below the original anchors (because a slab fell off that led to the old anchor).This is not a very good route to top-rope, as it is nearly 140 feet high. Furthermore, you'll DEFINITELY want to back up the anchors for belaying your second- if you even use them at all.All in all, there is good climbing on this route.

One take just before the widest part - trust those fists \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. 10+ if you stay in the wide and don't use finger crack. fun little route 1 #5 2 #4 \u00b7 Follow. Followed Coles lead as the first climb of the trip. Challenging off width crux. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. W/ Claire. Rattly fist jams for the meat of it. Couldn\u2019t get a knee in, but found just enough face holds. Got some arm bars in at the top. For 40\u2019 it\u2019s all there. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Everything else seemed busy, so got on this one. Ok climb. Might have been better if hadn't stopped at the 50ft anchors? (MR) \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Harder than it looks. Wider than I thought. I hate it when that happens. \u00b7 TR. Hung. Very challenging wide bit. Used thin crack out right but couldn't make feet work \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Took halfway up. Rattly fists is tough! Good climb though. Should try again. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Just went up to anchors at Idk 40\u2019. Sewed it up - bring 1 #2, 1 #3 and 4 #4. Took several takes and hangs and readjust hangs, was tough to keep gear out of the way of feet \u00b7 TR. hard off width. there were bugs swarming all around us. Driz put it up. climbed with nate drezia and amy \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Way hard transitioning from bottom hands to top OW and finger sidepul crack. Doubles bd# 1 to 3 and a 4.

Tried layback fingers up until Cruz for fun, break from 3\u201d fist jams. \u00b7 TR. Not clean but hard and fun. Bulge is crux. Went out right to get through it \u00b7 TR. Such intense layback, even choicier finger tips up top, stemming out is the only way. 3 takes \u00b7 TR. TR'd after leading Gorilla. Fun liebacking leads to a section of tippy tips that I simply couldn't pull through (fingers aren't strong enough). After surmounting the bulge, fun 5.9+ climbing in the left crack (avoiding Gorilla) leads to the chains! A bit contrived since Gorilla is off, but fun nonetheless! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Ripped a .2 out just below the crux, bury the gear deeper and it goes just fine. \u00b7 TR. TR after climbing Gorilla. made it clean up to just after the tips lie back starts, swung over to finish on Gorilla a body length or so before they join. got good fingers and some stances in the first clean section. I did better than I expected. \u00b7 TR. not sure when to use both cracks, heady lead, back still hurts too much to lieback \u00b7 TR. Toproped until the bulge, then switched to the handcrack. So It was probably 5.11- for me. Still felt hard, but the grade seems about right. This climb seems pretty lame - an elimination problem in the creek? Why? \u00b7 TR. Nur F Nflash Small Tips layback Crux, wo eigentlich der Gorilla-Riss danach schreit, mitbenutzt zu werden. Cool. \u00b7 TR. didn't figure out how to do the crux, just liebacking it doesn't seem 11 to me \u00b7 TR. Laid back to the bulge in one go. Gets very thin right before the bulge. Our guide told us this route was called Gorilla Warfare \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. The crux came as a tight 00 for about 15\u2019 about halfway up. There was no chance of a clean go, as I was fried by the time I reached the crux. \u00b7 TR. W/ Riley. Hopped on it after leading Pigs in a Slot. Nice to try. Jammed a fair bit of the crack, but the thin stemming at the crux would\u2019ve been a little heady on lead. \u00b7 TR. got up about 30' without issue. then when it got super thin, swung over to Gorrilla to try that #noshame \u00b7 TR. Really fun! TRed Gorilla bottom and switched over to this at the layback section. Damn it gets thin. Top is really fun! Amazing! \u00b7 TR. Fun lie backing with good rests to a seam bit contrived near the top one hung it \u00b7 TR. Hung at the thin section. Tips for me and pumpy. Would be a hard lead to hang in and place gear. \u00b7 TR. Excellent laybacking. Very hard, esp when it pinched. Same anchor as Gorilla Crack \u00b7 TR. Clean TR, pretty chill. Placing gear would add considerably to the physical difficulty \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Lots of small gear. Almost whipped when 2.5\" Hairy spider crawled into crack VERY close to my hand. \u00b7 Tr burn after gorilla, only used the corner, tough moves not obvious where it thins down to nada \u00b7 TR. Strenuous layback. Feet were pretty slick in some areas. Fingers got reaaal thin. \u00b7 TR. Dogged Crux which was half way up. Super thin fingers. First half layback. Second half tight flaring hands. \u00b7 TR. TR Flash. Stayed with the corner crack. Nice face features for lieback at thin sections. \u00b7 TR but not clean. This is HARD thin fingers liebacking. Super fun, and aesthetic but very athletic \u00b7 Took @crux, needed smaller gear. Would be better if it wasn't so close to the other climb"

Don't wear a helmet. Do tell your belayer to wear one. \u00b7 TR. Did in 2 pitches with 5 people haha, I followed and trailed a 2nd rope \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead. Fun. With NREL.

Had to bump 2\u2019s 3\u2019s for the second half of the climb \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead. Led in one pitch. Rope got heavy, so recommend doing in 2 to make it more fun \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Hung, ran out of red cams and had to back clean (brought 2 but used one on the bottom, need to save at least 2 for the top). 2x0.3, 1x0.4, 2x1, 4x2, 5x3. 80m barely makes it. Rope got stuck in chimney (need to do the 2x rap) \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Really fun off the beaten track climb. An 80 works for both. \u00b7 2 pitches. TR. With Devin. Lead it next time, so much fun! Splitter 3/2/1 crack for the second pitch. Amazing! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Did it as one long pitch with lots of rope drag even though I ran out the chimney. Took at the very top right before the chains as it narrows down to #1 size. Definitely didn't need to take though - couple moves of tight hands but there are edges for feet. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard first climb in creek for me, led as two pitches and rested once in #3s, and where #2s turned to #1s from there I was worked and kept taking, ended up pulling on some of the 1s. Will be back with more crack technique! \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. 3x.3, 3x.4, 1x .75, 2x #1 5x #2-#3, optional #4 (or additional #3) off fingers at the top is definitely not the crux, face holds appear and the angle lessens. The crux is where the crack gets wider, but not deep enough with a \"too thin\" crack in the back of it.. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Did this in the spring with Jacob Sternberg. Excellent route 2 pitches. \u00b7 2 pitches. Follow. W/MT. First pitch: finger crack .3, .4. No gear needed in chimney. Second pitch: 1,2,3s. Mostly 2s. Pinches down to 1 at the top. Good for a lead next time. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Led as 1 pitch & lowered with 80. Matt climbed and rapped 2x. Three .3s for start, couple #4s, all of the #3s, 3-4 #2s, 2 1s, 1 .75 for top. Fun & shady when everything else was baking. The OW has runout bolts now \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. My poor hands needed more tape before the climb Very fun offwidth/finger crack at the start \u00b7 Retro-ticked.. did with Matt a year or 2 ago. Super fun!!! Wonder if the off width off the pillar has ever been done. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. small yellow and blue tcus for fingers then two 1s for the chimney, didn't do the second pick \u00b7 We belayed at the back of the chimney using red Camalots for the anchor. \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Onsight. Super fun, #3 gear in second pitch. Crux at top. \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. recycled gear from the bottom! so i got to climb the thing twice! super surprised! \u00b7 TR. great hand crack with new sharp edges, at suoercrack buttress! strenuous top out with tight hands."

The top was slightly wider hands, and I found it easier to swim through it \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Looooong, and the same move. Would be more enjoyable with more than 3 3s. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Took on my 3rd to last piece, I placed stupidly on a bent right arm at the roof. Run it out more after the roof and place on your L hand sometimes! \u00b7 TR. Despite my assumptions about worn down classics, this is in fact a pretty super crack \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Led/ on sighted P1/P2 linked, then Ryan and I had a bit of an epic on the top pitch. But we got to the rim \u00b7 Lead. Did first pitch. 1 and .75 grey to start and get to the crack. Heavy on 3s brought 6c maybe 4 yellow, and a couple red. Didn\u2019t use the 4 on first pitch but the second definitely needs a handful \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Bottom part was a struggle before the crack. My glove ripped 10 ft below the chains so I don\u2019t get to top out. Great crack! \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Brought mostly 3s and 4s for some reason. Had to down climb to back clean. Hard start! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Made it to the mini roof and did bad with resting. Very bad pump up top \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 2 hung, daddy set up a stick clip for the bottom \u00b7 Lead. Only lead half and the rope got stuck below me :) had to lower and cut the rope then go again \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Apote\u00f3sico, letal para mi mano. Pareciera que estuviese nadando \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Flash. Suuuupa crack unda da Suuuupa Mooon Perfect weather at 10pm With Meeeeeeeeson Meeseeks Man \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Despite John and Matt\u2019s popping, tagged this classic and quite enjoyed it. Sprinted up the pumpy 3s crack placing minimal gear to save energy. Did actually almost barn door off the start\u2026 overall good, but hard to call it any different from any other splitter. Like an easier Fat Cat \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. I freaked myself out on the first section but found good jams across the awkward boulder. Lost steam in the upper crack. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Redpoint. We're not worthy! Such a good experience. Sent with only 4 blue cams \u00b7 TR. This thing is epic! The wide spot at the top of the flake is funky, I got a shallow right hand jam around the corner to help me establish my feet on the face to go over the bulge. Just gotta move slow and careful, can get a .5 up high in the crack to the left of the bulge. The rest of the crack is so straight It\u2019s crazy Endurance for sure But it\u2019s vertical so you can put a lot of weight on your legs I had good hands for a little while then I was full forearm in jamming the meat of my forearm and my elbow in the crack Got lots of rests by squeezing my booty cheeks and staying tight to the wall with my legs and resting on my elbow I\u2019d totally lead this! \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Definitely a super classic and aesthetic line. Boulder problem down low isn\u2019t too hard. Next time bring more 2s for the middle. Crux was not stepping on my own rope, and enduring the pain of endless cupping. Crack gloves might finally be on the wish list. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Climbed this one through sunset on my last day of the trip. What an awesome way to wrap up an awesome trip! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Clean through the 3s. Hung at the start and at the roof. Noah\u2019s gear was still up so basically a sport climb. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Super wide hands, with arms in 3/4 up to my elbows. Doing more like forearm lock with handjam inside. Really hard, really sustained. Made it but scraped my arms real good \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. felt strong. couldnt do anything but swim my arms up (top hand thumb down), stand up, and repeat. Fun route. W/ Denver crew + Austin \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Bottom was way more chill than expected \u2014 #2, .2, .75 (extended) to sew it up. Crux is the endurance through to the chains. \u00b7 Many 2 , get all the feet in. Tricky start place a purple on the rock buldge above at the start \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Lead onsight 1-2 aid the 3. NEVER DO THE 3th pitch \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Midnight climb under the moonlight with no head lamp. One of the coolest experiences of my life. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Pumpy ! Otherwise just a box to check. 4-6 #3 cams, depending on comfort level ? Met Kat and Zack and their friend with the small dog family. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Took a fall and hung twice after; gotta come back when I can actually climb a splitter \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Nighttime beatdown. Need 100\u2019 of the last part of the climb \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Freaking fun stuff. Headlight ascent at night. Got to about 20 feet out from the chains. So so good. \u00b7 TR. Mock lead and popped off once from the pump. Baggy hands were tiring \u00b7 TR. most exposed, longest route i\u2019ve ever done. chicken winged and laybacked most of it, my fists were too small \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Incredible. Jug jug jug in a crack. Friction on this one is immaculate. Racing the sun. 1-#1, 3-#2, 3-#3. One more 3 if you want to sew it up. Just the first pitch \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Sunset. Took a rest on the way up, but holy cow what an incredible route! The opening move was trickier than I was expecting. 1x1, 2x2, 5x3 and a purple totem for the opening move sewed it up. \u00b7 TR. Oof, hard to jam. Didn\u2019t make it up the crack. Start was fine \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Did pitch 1. Only had 3 3\u2019s so I had to run it out around 15 feet a piece. But it was sooo fun \u00b7 TR. First climb of the night and did it with a headlamp. Night climbing is fun. Small freak out when a big spider was on a key hold at the bottom. Took some takes as today was supposed to be a rest day and this got me pumped. I think I\u2019m a fan of 3\u2019s. Had all the fun and cleaned it but left ankle kept getting really sore. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Did the first pitch. Didn\u2019t bring #2s and had to come back down.. the crux is weird but doable. Just commit to face climbing and place a 0.5 around the corner. Climbed this terribly, got pumped after the crux and had to keep taking my way up even though it was EZ. Bring lots of 3s, and at least 3 2s. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. Super if you have big hands... just another splitter 3s pitch. \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Hardest route I\u2019ve ever done! Cardio, pain, jam jam jam. Exhausted but went again haha. A classic \u00b7 TR. Pretty fun. Rested at the roof. Sustained. Fists for me at the top. \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Top roped it, ill be back for the lead. Found it easier to layback the first section rather than try to jam it. Not sure how placing gear would be with this technique though \u00b7 Lead / Flash. With sarah and martha. Bouldery hard to protect well start followed by 2s to 3s crack. Used 4 2s and 5 3s but ran it out and swam up. So fun. Could lap. Martha used 8 3s and wanted 10. We got a 3 stuck that took an hr to get out. \u00b7 1 pitch. First pitch only. As good as advertised. Funky climbing to ledge, then 2s to lip, 3s to chains. \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Made it through the boulder problem clean, used a .75, fell a few times on the crack \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. Your belayer will love it if you ask for beta anywhere on the crack \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Fell/Hung. Wow. Just wow. I got super pumped by the last 20' so I took twice. \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. TRashed. Start is a little tricky, then cruiser to the anchors. \u00b7 1 pitch. TR. So much fun!! bomber hands to cups but so so good w the ocun gloves \u00b7 1 pitch. Lead / Onsight. with pat/joanie/foster/cheryl. super fun on super crack! 1x 0.5 1x 1 3x 2s 5x 3s \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Endurofest. Bottom was a bit cruxy and awkward, used 3 #2s and then 8 #3s at the top and a way over cammed #4 for the last part before moving out right to the chains."

Anchor was just left at the top of the big squeeze \u00b7 TR. Begininning is easy bc of face ledges for feet so not proper crack climbing needed. Crux is the squeeze thru the narrow opening and how awkard moving thru that was. Full body camming. I got my shoulders kinda stuck at one point. I ended up going to a jug on the right side and facing out toward the sky side of the crack. Once you've wriggled out of that, it's easy but you can either chimney with no gear or get on the pillar/face and climb that. Anchors are chains, no musseys, on the flat side of the crack to the left if you're looking up at it from the ground. Small gear largely at least at the beginning \u00b7 TR. Followed in Crocs, such a fantastic silly Willy climb. A bunch of .4s low, then 2,3,2 then runout to anchor but what a great squeeze bit. Simon's first crack Trad lead! \u00b7 TR. loose rocks and lack of a bolt to protect the chimney at the top ruin an otherwise awesome climb \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Great fun, good for extending your time at the crag on a hot day. Not sure what the fuss is about being poorly protected at the start, crack begins immediately off the deck and can be well protected until the final chimney (could be avoided and well protected by climbing up opposite wall at ledge). \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Doubles .4,.5, 3. Orange metolius would have been nice. Could do 2 or 1 but not needed \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Crack Camp. I wanted to onsight something - Mary thought this would be a good one and Sam let me have it (no spoilers)! Thought this was a ton of awkward fun! My legs seemed long enough to chimney the top so I did. \u00b7 TR. Trd in crack camp. So fun and good pro except the committing last move up onto the pillar. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. My third lead in the creek! Super fun climb with totally different moves than most climbs here \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Crazy fun route. If my ass was any bigger I wouldn\u2019t have fit! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Really fun!!!!!!! Lots not great but once in it is awesome! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Literally being birthed. I was so not fitting. Little boy said fun so I did it \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Wtf. I have never fit through such a small gap. Expect for birth. So much fun. And weird. Felt great. \u00b7 TR. Feel pretty save to lead on this route after TP, but want to save time for other crack route so didn\u2019t lead, will try next time. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Allison hated it, but I enjoyed some of the funky movement being birthed up through the tight chimney. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. with S, what a riot, singles 0.5-3, doubles 0.3 and 0.4 \u00b7 TR. Like hilarious and not hard but funny and weird haha. Take new people here for laughs and fun \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Fun and cool in the shade. 3 each .4, .5 2 .75 1 3, 3.5, 4 to place then back clean. \u00b7 TR. Day 3 Crack Camp - got a little claustrophobic on the first attempt and came down to take a breath. Clean on the second attempt. \u00b7 TR. fun to squeeze through the small area down low. was really glad I wasn't leading when I got to the chimney section up top \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Fun warm up, good for the first time leader. Single rack 0.4-2, double 0.4."

Had to try it after Celia sent it clean. Put in 7 cams total? Need like 3 #3s ideally. Placed one as my first piece in the right crack where it's a bit curvy and then mostly on the left crack (.75, 1, 2?, .5?) nothing smaller than .75 or so I think. Had 2 #3s and it was fine but could place at least one more if I could. Can extend if you place on the left and move over right right after. Didnt put gear in after the one piece after moving over to the right crack fully. Top is musseys \u00b7 TR. Started with hand in the chalky splitter crack on the left and feet and right hand in the right crack at the bottom. Kinda awkwardly large on the right side for a bit at the bottom but stick your arm in far enough and trust the good left hand jam splitter to move past it. Theres a really good jug pocket thing you can use on the right for hands and then foot. Eventually you'll start hugging the pillar by getting a hand in the left crack that isn't the splitter and you can either do toe jams with feet in both cracks or stick a left foot out for a smear/stem. Good little pronounced divots for right foot that help you feel secure. Felt spooked at the section where you move over to the right crack fully with both feet. and then it gets wider/flaring as you go up but found the beta that works is to get good left hand/arm jam and then secure your left foot in the crack to bump up until you can stand on the good right face footholds and eventually reach some chalky jugs to the right and then it's jugs from there. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Strongest lead yet. Felt confident. Austin almost booty\u2019d a 5 (returned it). W SP + Z \u00b7 Lead. 2 x 0.4, 1 0.75, 1 x 0.5, 1 x 1.0, 2 x 2.0, 1 x 3.0 (Left side gear beta from Liv) I used 1 x 4 on right side \u00b7 Lead / Flash. * 2xyellow totem * 1x green BD * 1x purple totem * 1x red totem * 2 gold BD * 1 x3 BD For left crack \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Bumped my 3 too many times, but fun climb over all! \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. set up mock lead for ava. went left of block this time. fun but harder. need runner for 3 at top of block \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Going to the right is straightforward but much wider. Bring a 4 for the top. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. So cool to come back to this one and send it on lead after my 2016 TR. went left at top. Good edges up high. But awkward. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Used 0.75 and one #1 and one #2 , 2x #3 But i would next time take a few 0.3-0.4s so I can place my feet in the crack and not screw my protection. Also I used mostly the finger and left crack. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Great warm up route! First lead ever in Indian Creek, I continued up into the 5.10 flake \u00b7 Follow. Fun, varied climb with good stances to rest. Before the anchors used faced holds on right and shimmied left arm/leg up. Stays shaded until mid day \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. No beta, placed a 2 and a 3. Met Mary Eden \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Ended up going up left side at the top with #2 size. 2nd go on TR did the right side #4 crack with fist jams \u00b7 TR. Crack Camp. Mock led as a warm up for day 3. Enjoyable and benign, but I didn't realize the upper crack widened into #4s. Glad I took up a #4 - ended up bumping this. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Should have brought alpine draws because I placed gear in both cracks but only climbed the left :/ \u00b7 Lead / Flash. I climbed this twice. Once on TR to mock lead and then lead the second go. Super fun \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. 2nd lead in the creek, cruiser! A great beginner lead with cool moves \u00b7 Sweet cruiser; it was so fun! Wide at parts but the double crack made it cruisey- my crux was the start but using the tiny lil finger crack vs the OW was easier for my smol hands"

Lead up off the ground in pretty fun big fingers lieback, some cool OW slot moves, then hands in a deepening slot to find a modernish Rawl bolt with a stopper hanger. Climbed another 30 or so feet into the deepening and ever muddier chimney to a large hanging tombstone that was moving just when I was wiggling a cam to get it set in the dirt. SO I DOWN CLIMBED BACK TO THE NUT/BOLT AND BAILED.The new book has vague info about this route that I have to believe is not firsthand based on how awful the climbing was above the bolt. Says 5.11 but no warning about how muddy it gets or loose death blocks. There IS a anchor up high but I'm skeptical that going straight up from the bolt is how it got there. But maybe I'm a wimp?I am posting to see if anybody has info about the FA, or if Karl can add anything to the description in the book.Also, I am wondering if the odd bolt was actually used to tension into the better looking crack to the right, or maybe I missed a free opportunity to get over there? If so, this could be an amazing route after all, but the lack of info makes me wonder if it was ever even freed, or stinks so bad that it was better left to obscurity.There is a good #1 Camalot crack at the bolt, but deep in the slot so wouldn't be very functional to help get to the other crack. The bolt is a few feet out of the slot. Certainly a bolt would have been more appropriate higher up by the blocks seeing how the climbing at the bolt is easy and well protected.By the time I lowered, I was spitting dirt out of my mouth, eyes, ears, nose and I didn't look around much while bailing from that weird relic.Also, if another bolt was added at the one I bailed from to make an anchor, it would actually be a fun little varied route. 70 feet or so. Blasphemy, I know. But if the full route was never actually freed, or is a gross and dangerous pile, maybe that'd be appropriate? But then again, does Supercrack need another little 2 star route?I'll update this description from the comments if any info is clarified.",

W/ Luke. Fun! Would like the pillar to be slightly more attached but good thin hands. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. crushed it nicely, fast style. heavy .75s and 1s are all, you need, with an optional couple 2 & 3 if desired. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Actually really fun when I get my head around it, Climbed with Madison \u00b7 TR. Followed Melinda's lead. Hard for me, since #1s and 0.75s are really thin for me. I had to lieback in a few spots, and jamming my fat hands into the thin sections was tenuous and painful! \u00b7 TR. 1s and .75s the whole way! project for me. This is the one my ankle popped on \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. W maegin, great shady route, should be more popular but I\u2019m glad it isn\u2019t \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Got in my head and scared. Hung every few pieces but then TRed it and it was super fun and chill. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Super great to flash a 5.11- in the creek especially since it was my second route \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. endurance is definitely not my thing today. could probably send on a normal day. #2 or #3 is good for one spot, a .5 was good too. otherwise .75 and #1, plenty of them. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. fun tight hands with DF and Jamie. black mets and red camalots are the name of the game \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Several hangs on lead, followed by clean TR lap. Only had 2 green C4s and wanted more. Next time might bring 2x 0.5 or red metolius, 4x 0.75, 6x #1, and at least 1x #2 and/or #3. Very good pitch despite slightly hollow sounding blocks down low and flake up by the anchor. \u00b7 Follow. Physically exhausting. Started right thumb up left thumb down. At the halfway switched to right thumb down. Also used some lay back to get through tough middle section where the crack was small, and again near the anchor. \u00b7 Lead. I love this route! Bring more number #1\u2019s and 2 black Metolius. .75 work but tipped out. 1 #2 and .5 guided this twice. Feels more 5.10 \u00b7 Lead / Flash. psyched! fun climb. I had 1x2 2 x1's 3x.75s and 1x.5 bring like 5 or 6 x .75 and 1s ideally \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Redpoint. Hard sandy tight ones between loose #1 pods. Very pumpy, the sandiness of the crack made it feel very slippery \u00b7 TR. i tried 2 times. second time was way better. climbed with Sarah. this route is more of a 5.10+ \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Had to take once towards the top as I was running out of #1. Next time I lead it I\u2019ll bring 6 #1s or try to place more .75s in the lower section. \u00b7 TR. Tried this on TR. Made it up to the corner but didn\u2019t have the technique/endurance to survive the corner \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. #1s for beginning splitter. Large section of .75s in middle of corner....punch it!!!! .5 at top \u00b7 TR. Clean on TR, love this route - perfect hand all the way up \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 1 hang. well worth doing, but i got scared not bringing enough gear. \u00b7 Onsight. Many reds and greens. 2 golds 1 blue 1 0.5 camalot. Added one bolt to anchor."

The .75 bulge was the crux for me, but if you can pull that you can probably send the route 4X .5-2 would be plenty of gear. Plus 1 .4 and a couple 3s \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Whipped at the roof and took a couple times but made it to the chains! \u00b7 Lead. Fucking pump town! Zack put the bad boy up I was too tired to pull the roof on lead \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fewhang (both bulges). 3 1s up to first roof (one bump), then 2x2, 4-5 .75s, few .5s, then major rest. Few more .5s, then two 1s for last bulge (bump top one) and finish on easy ground after pulling bulge \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard, didn't lay back at all but tiny crack foot game was great \u00b7 Full rack , crux at the top , don\u2019t lay back get feet in it \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Lots of 1s and .75s. Enduro crux. So pumped. Many falls and takes \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Led first half up to .75s section! Very fun. Tricky to move through .75s - layback? \u00b7 TR. Gave it a clean TR burn after my onsight attempt and my learnings felt good \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. With mango. .3, 2 .4, 4 .5, 4 .75, 4x 1, 1x 2 This is a really fun varied route and I thought it was more like 5.11 for the creek. Worked a lot of my weaknesses and think I could send it fresh next time. Purples after crux 1 I fell and crux 2 I fell but found my sequence and how to use my inside hand \u00b7 TR. Mock lead. Would bring X2 .4, x5 .5, x5 0.75, x4 1, x4 2, X1 3. The lack back is powerful and goes from 0.76 to 0.5 with sandy slopey feet. The roof is really hard with 1s, but hands are shitty \u00b7 TR. Hung a few times. Hard route, long and sustained! I went into it too tired and rattly fingers weren\u2019t it \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. would try to go back for a clean lead! unfortunately i arrived at the top without a #1, and definitely wanted it. very long and varied \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. W/ Adrian. Very hard, but enjoyed it a lot. Very committing laybacks, but manageable. Bring 5-6 .75s and .5s, 3-4 1s, 3-4 2s, a 3, and a .5. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. with pat/joanie/foster/cheryl! Fun route tough liebacking 3x .5 ? 3x .75? 2x 1 1x 2 1x 3 \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Sooo cold this day... everything felt way hard. Had to aid last section. super excited to come back and try this for real! the movement is amazing \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Chef\u2026 amazing line. Interesting climbing and varied sizes. Long climb and crux comes almost at the end, pulling a small roof to #1 crack \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Flash. excellent! good to feel better again after coyne. 3, 4x1, 3x.75, red orange and yellow mc, .4. plus a TR lap \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. So close! One fall near the top, slipped off when I didn\u2019t even think I would! Bottom and top are #1, good mix of smaller stuff between. Used 0.4-3 with double #0.5, 5x #0.75, 4x #1, 3x #2, and one #3 (when you reach the #3 midway up place it there). Optional #2 at the end before the anchor. Bring extra #0.5-1 if pushing limit. Some decent hand jamming for me, not too much layback, good rests too. No clips. \u00b7 TR. TR this as sun was coming down so the pressure to finish made me climb well \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. With Bronwyn and Anton. Excellent pitch. Very few .4s needed. Lots of .75s \u00b7 TR. w/ Bronwyn Burman & Rainbow Weinstock after FD Programs. RW Led. Hung out with Danny B & Courtney (Red Moon Lodge) who gave me a ride back to town. \u00b7 TR. Glad I didn\u2019t lead it this time. Both bulges felt really hard to me on TR. \u00b7 TR. Followed Chris's lead. This would be a hard lead. Lots of liebacking, plus a thin hands bulge crux at the top. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at top crux. Felt nails going straight in- super greasy and awkward. Laying it back seems to be the move. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Felt casual this year, fun seeing how technique and comfort level have improved. \u00b7 TR. No1s we\u2019re great and good semi rests before crux - crux is reasonable. Route is apparently sandbag but felt ok honestly. Only one hung at crux \u00b7 TR. Lead it next time it goes awesome. Gear : 2x.4, 3x.5, 5x.75-1, prob 1x2&3 \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Got spanked on lead but did it clean on TR. Very physical lie-backing. Felt 10++ \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. One fall at the roof Only used 2 .5s. Would take 5th 1 or .75 \u00b7 TR. Toproped - kind of a shame, it's a beautiful climb, but I wasn't feeling up for a long 5.10+ lead. It's cruiser except the crux up top, which was pretty hard and I laybacked it. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Got pretty worked on this one. Beginning is pretty chill thin hands to the first bulge. Get like the crux was the first bulge 0.75s - just need to commit to the layback. Hard couple of moves out of the alcove too \u00b7 2 pitches. Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at first bulge hangs and French free at second. Hardest 10 I\u2019ve ever done, not much easier than Desert Vaurnet. Fell at upper bulge on TR, first time falling on 5.10 TR in over a year \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. First creek climb! One fall at the first crux, one hang at the second. Bring 1x #2, and at least triples, maybe 4x .4-1. W/ Manny, Dana and Jeff. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. sweet line. hard for creek 10 or just hard warm up \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Stout for 10. Lots of .75s. Need to feel more comfortable working the feet to find stances to place \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Burley, felt harder than 10+ for me. 2nd bulge was burly tight hands \u00b7 TR. hung. overhang tight hands. lots of layback to get thru. tiring. nice route. would do again if better at 1s \u00b7 TR. Tony on lead, fell / hung. Camryn, Perry, and Tony on top rope. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. 5 of everything from .5-2, take 2 x .4 , 1 x 3, 1 x 3.5, 5 x runners \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell at second roof bc I placed then my right pinky slipped down onto my cam causing it to be crushed. 1 hung then sent. Pinky still numb. Moral: Trust your gear and run it out to the stance. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Did not like this climb. Felt like I couldn\u2019t place gear while holding the layback. Could have been that my feet where too high \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. attempted to lead but unable to finish the last bulge. ran out of hear to sit through. jac went up and finished it. STIFF for the grade \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. a fucking good time. probably 10 takes. definitely thin hands at times, but super fun. layback -y \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Would be 4 stars if it wasn\u2019t so rounded over and well-loved. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. I fell at the #1 placements near the anchors. Soo close. I got scared and didn\u2019t commit to the move, even though I had a great placement below me. Next time:) I met a ton of climbers:) Mo, chrisx2, Alan, Ben. So fun. I climbed with Cody and Daniel \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. First day in the creek with chicken Zach and jack! Lol, was resting at the last Bulge, 5 feet below the chains, foot slipped. Surprise \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. W Laura! Shot dang! Awesome route. Long and sustained. Took at the upper bulge below and above haha. 5x#1,5x.5 5x.75,2x#2 2x.4. 1x#3. \u00b7 Lead. 2x.4, 3x.5, 5x.75, 5x1, 2x2. Wished I had a 3 at the top for awkward moves way above gear but oh well \u00b7 Lead / Flash. led it after Jon, Calley tr'ed and set up a fixed line for photos. the first bulge was hard but I just committed to the layback. second bulge was harder since I didn't trust my feet, and ran out of gear (bring more .75s, .5s, and #1s next time). wild and super fun! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. The 2s pod after the layback comes up blind. Next time I need to plug two and gun the layback \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Lol so hard. Was not mentally prepared for all the laybacking..,did some hanging on gear in order to place gear. Rad climb, tho. Final roof pull is committing and great. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Hard at the .75 bulgey bit but very fun up to there"

                "route_tick_comments": "\u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. Yay! First 10 lead in the creek. Clean lead after TRing once last spring. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Just p1? Unsure of how this climb works. A couple 1s, many 2s, 2 3s. .75 and .5 for tje top. A .5 to protect the start \u00b7 Lead. Fun! I thought it would be mostly 1s but it was mostly 2s! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. Fun! 4x 2s was nessicary. A few 3s and 1s and .75. Start was tricky, forgot about the perfect hand jam to the right. \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. W Cole Super fun, as good as the extremely popular 10s nearby. Yellow met and .75 for initial boulder, then 1, 2x4, 3x3, 2x .5 \u00b7 TR. Clean TR. tricky start, bit burly angled offwidth, good crack in middle, nice edges at top and good feet on face \u00b7 TR. Thin, powerful bouldery start then hand jams. A few very awkward pods that sucked me in \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. with akhil! rest up in the OW pod, there\u2019s a ways to go to the anchors from there! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. @Crack Camp! Took a proper whip on gear at the upper part of the flare. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Crack Camp. I wanted 1 hard lead, this was Sam's rec. He pre-placed 2 pieces above the thin start. It was my first time having someone coaching me thru on a fixed line the whole way up - I loved it!! I brought up 8 #2s, Sam back cleaned 2 for me so I guess I placed 10 #2s?? Pumped off on the zigzag, took twice in the OW pod. \u00b7 TR. Haley trd in crack camp. I made it so close to the top before having to rest. \u00b7 TR. Multiple falls on the start. Middle section was the first straight on crack I\u2019ve climbed and the best feeling crack of the trip. Top third was deep and a challenge to get through. Multiple takes but honestly favorite crack of the trip. \u00b7 Lead / Redpoint. With Brady, Sean, and Lance. Felt pretty good, pod part was weird. 2.5 piece would be nice \u00b7 Super fun! Most of it was doable for me\u2026the crux was the big flare near the top\u2026I can try to climb outside the crack or I have to get hand jams way deep in the crack but I slipped out and then went outside the crack \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Fell once after the pod. Save a .75 and .5 for the top. Super fun! \u00b7 Lead / Flash. .4 at start protects the hard down low. Pod and .75 Sandy top was tricky but went easier than 3AM. \u00b7 Lead / Flash. Encouraged my mark and crew. Clean send. Super proud and happy. \u00b7 TR. hero move to save the ladies rope! lily finished after a tough battle i also messed up the toprope set up real bad \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. Pulled through offwidth pod, but climbed clean later on a top rope burn. Secure and way fun! \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. I pulled the first half clean (start on one foot was stupid as the feet are left)...bottom is definitely crux. Stoked to put it down. \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. .3, #1, #2(3), #3, #2(3), #1, .75 Good climb with great variability in movement. Couple tricky pods with lots of sinker jams! \u00b7 Lead / Onsight. solid climb but doesn't match up to all of the amazing routes on the cliff. gear 0.5, .75, 3x1 and 5x2 \u00b7 TR. Bit of an awkward start, to amazing 2s, to a techy pod with hands in the back. Exciting (but short) finger section to chains. Not R, fun. Tanner lead \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. great variety and a fun but awkward crux flare. one hang there \u00b7 Lead / Fell/Hung. I took 5-7 #2\u2019s. I took once at the bulge. The 2\u2019s felt baggy. \u00b7 TR. Day 3 Crack Camp - didn\u2019t make it to the top but got a decent 10 ft section of continuous hand crack climbing! Highlight of the camp! \u00b7 TR. Biffed the bottom then struggled thru the flares. Harder than 3am crack in that way for me. Good crack practice all the same. \u00b7 TR. made it to the anchors cheating a fair bit on the top section. dont have the endurance for that yet \u00b7 TR. Pushed through most of the vertical hand crack \u2014 tiring, but quite doable. Struggled with body maneuvering in the pod, but made it work!"
