Our experience was slightly chossy but the surprise gloryhole descent really loosened us up for adventure. Get on this route and to clean it up for an epic line in a neat area.pitch 1: choose your own adventure through loose blocks and trees on easy terrain. pass a giant pine tree and a bolted belay (dont use). walk up and left on a bushy, dirty ledge to the base of obvious right facing sick hand crack. sling a tree for an anchor. 5.6pitch 2: starts same as edge of absurdity - shoot up the epic mcsplitter but short, right facing hand crack. We found this to be the route finding crux. the way we ended up going was up and left, up discontinuous cracks and a couple traversing face moves out to a *sweet* plushy ledge with a tree to belay from. 5.8 (the way we went)pitch 3: couldnt find any 10c that the topo called out, but from the plush ledge go up the big flake, using it as good hands while traversing right on smearing feet. clip a bolt and pull this pitch's crux (5.9+), then up past a tree, then belay from the bolted anchors or second tree (to avoid rope drag) just below the HUGE right facing corner crux pitch.\u00a0pitch 4: 5.11b crux. jam and lieback for a while up to the epic mantling exit. felt similar to the moratorium but quite dirty and mossy and ferny. continue up past some dirty 5.9 #3s low angle ledgey corner for 20 feet or so to a tree to belay from. you should be looking up at a little corner with an underclinging exit. this pitch has a lot of cleaning to be done as of May 2024.pitch 5: go up the short corner, surmount it and go up the LOW angle slab to a 2 bolt anchor. its very hard to see, but its JUST to the right of all the dirt, and just below an undercling. short pitch, but would be bad to combine with p4. could be combined with p6. 50ft, 5.8.pitch 6: traverse right for ~20 feet on 5.5 slab out to a single bolt almost even with the belay. go up (commit!), and a bit right towards the skyline to find where the gear starts about 15 feet up and right from the bolt. the further up you go the easier it gets. once you get up on a ledge, you should be at a 2 bolt anchor that's also pretty tough to spot. if you miss it, then just build an anchor on something that isnt lose (godspeed). 5.5.pitch 7: 4th/5th class scrambling up to the top. pick a tree and belay on terra firma.same descent as edge of absurdity. hunt around for the bolts with chains to rap down to the vent tunnel. they felt about 100 feet to the right of the top out.",

                "route_description": "This is a pretty unique route. The climbing and rock are pretty good in a few spots (and dirty in many others) but what really makes it worthwhile is the position. It climbs right along the lip of a really steep wall and, combined with the slab of the Cookie Sheet below, makes for a really exposed endeavor. There are some decent runouts on traversing terrain and route finding issues to deal with. The cherry on top is the descent, unique in all the valley. Altogether, a great adventure.Here's a thread with some more beta: Supertopo\u00a0P1 - this is a total junker up through choss and dirt. Fire activity has mostly burned all the PO but has also made the soil very unstable. Anyway, aim up and right for a large, living pine tree. Pass this then head up and left through some mantles and bushes to the base of a nice hand crack.P2 - up the handcrack then step out on the slab to avoid bushes. pass an oak and belay near dead pine.P3 - locate the first bolt out right, climb past it, then keep going up and right passing one more bolt that protects a hard mantle move. I didn't find any pins on this pitch. Belay at one bolt with a ring on it and small gear. There's a 2 bolt anchor clearly seen out right that I think is the top anchor to 'the higher truth' on the sugar cookie, but you don't climb to it.It sounds like many have bailed from this point, P4 looking a bit too gnarly. I think you could rap straight down and hit the anchor for 60/40 on the sugar cookie with one rope, but not 100% on that one. There is an easier variation to P4 that goes straight up. There is a bolt maybe 15 ft. up and bit left from the anchor. \"Afraid of the Edge\"P4 - big exposure! the crux moves come pretty close to the belay so it may be better to have stronger partner follow. blowing it while following would result in a ride over the edge. there was nothing \"blind\" about the moves, imo, just a hard foot match. anyway, clip a bolt 15 ft. right of the belay, head up a corner, then traverse right to another bolt. easier and runout climbing leads up and right past one more bolt. I belayed on a clean slab with a horizontal crack for gear. They call this 5.8+... whatever... 5.9.P5 - head up the corner to get established on the upper slab, traverse straight right to a bolt and climb the arete on jugs. some more awesome exposure here. belay at some small, living pines.P6 - this is kind of an unnerving pitch. head straight right, and even slightly down, to get established on the featured wall. follow the path of least resistance, mostly straight right. eventually, and hopefully, you will find a bolt. it's kind of hidden but just keep looking. Then head up to some black rock and perform some awesome and big moves on good rock, protected by good gear in a horizontal. You may wish to stop and belay at the big pine above. Otherwise, keep heading right on the dirty ledge to a big flake.P7 - climb the big flake/crack that leads to the top.",

Kind of inspires me to try the route without using the jug. Kind of. I found a link to a photo of Ray Jardine that shows the route in its original state here: house-under-a-rock.tumblr.c\u2026 Supertopo thread here: supertopo.com/climbing/thre\u2026 Regarding the grade, and having recently sent this myself, it seems to me that back in the days when 5.12 was new territory, a route had to be 12b before anyone dared to call it \"12a,\" which has pretty much been the case with each new grade over the generations. In the spirit of Yosemite tradition and a tip of the hat to the original badasses who blazed the way, I'll add my checkmark to \"11d.\" ;-) Edit to add: I just got off the phone with Ron Kauk, and also corresponded over email with Ray Jardine, and it's been helpful to clear up some facts about this route. The first (Ron) and second (Ray) ascents occurred in 1977 (so the \"1978\" listing above should be corrected). Ray also sent me a link to his Climbing Log, which he said he updated daily during his career, so the dates in it are generally quite accurate: rayjardine.com/Avocations/C\u2026 (Thanks to these guys for taking the time to share the info!)

After that you get a rest then it moves into beautiful thin hand jams up an overhanging wall. This route shouldn't feel as hard for people with thinner hands. Those with thicker hands may have trouble in the mid-section of the hand crack. I feel like I have normal sized hands and ended up getting about six real tight thumbs up jams in a row. The crack does widen up though so just keep cranken'. The last 15 feet is a tight squeeze chimmney that some people like myself end up liebacking. A classic 5.12 crack!
