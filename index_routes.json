Continue more or less straight, bushwhacking until you get the vertical wall of dirt. Straight ahead there should be a pile of large boulders about 30\u2019 tall, recognizable by one large Boulder at the top which has a huge hole beneath it (see photo). The trail goes up and LEFT from here and is quite steep and likely the only part of the trail that looks established. It might be tricky getting to this part but is MUCH preferable to going to the right of the floating block (trust me). Once on top of the boulder pile, head left for 3-5 minutes across the boulder field and you\u2019ll hit the problems.

I seem to... more Just a comment about the boulders in general. About 20 years before 2001 the boulders were located several hundred feet above the ground and were part of an A4 route. They came one stormy night I think in '82.  Then they were incredibly clean \"fresh\" rock.  There was a short flurry of popularity and some well known boulderers got in to the act including Dick Cilley and Todd Skinner.  I seem to remember Russell Erikson (cover shot on the Smith Guide) doing some crazy things in tennis shoes!  It is amazing to see how vegetated the area has become especially with regard to trees. Unfortunately most of the good boulders at the Town Walls were quarried.  Walking east from the Lower Wall just north of the RR tracks most of the large boulers or boulder remnants have ancient drill marks. I think that the quarry activity hardly impacted rope climbing but destroyed most of the good boulders. Ironically the quarry gave back what it once took. Feb 11, 2008",

The main difference was there was a ton of moss on the boulder and I only scrubbed the sloper traverse and the pinches on both sides. those two holds down low have come uncovered in my suprise that people are apparently climbing this thing quite a bit now. Problem was actually quite pretty from afar with the contrast of the green moss and the white chalk. Probably was actually a bit of a sandbag at v6 the way I did it first but your way looks like it flows better and is a better problem.

Then climb easy moves up the slab into the roof.

Yesterday, Sept 23rd I also free climbed to the quad summit after placing all gear on lead, just before a soaking rain descended on the valley. The grade may settle in the 13+ range for those 6' climbers, but on a personal note, I am convinced it was 14a for me, which would make this my most difficult gear lead, something I'd never imagine I could do at 47 with kids and profession. \u00a0But, the greatest joy of this project by far was the sense of mutual support I felt working it with Stamati ...cleaning, the beta mining sessions, figuring out the gear, believing in the gear, and of course the route itself which is perfection. \u00a0Thanks to all the folks whom contributed to the process: Tavish, Nate, Adam, Trevor, Cindy, Monica, Brock, Mark, Hunter and likely other I may have forgot.

Mantle up onto the sweet 2x2' perch and check out the views, surrounded by steep granite. After clipping another bolt, match a huge sloper and pull over left into another small RFC with an engaging finish, leading up to the Sky Lounge Ledge. 5.11aPitch 2 original: stay in the LFC the entire way. Gear looks sketchy up high, hard to place, and it is dirty still despite me scrubbing on it for hours. 10+?\u00a0Pitch 3: Ascend the aesthetic corner requiring classic index chicanery. \u00a0If you're tall it might feel 11d, if short more like 12+.

Yet the area does not retain cold pockets of air on clear winter days. Sunlight strikes the walls in the morning, leaving the rock in the shade from the early afternoon.With the adjacent areas of The Black Sea and the Lower Cheeks, this area has a concentration of climbing that rivals in quality and surpasses in scenic beauty any of the more traveled classics of the Lower Wall.For instance, the 2nd pitch of the Up'er Zipper is as good as steep crack climbing gets in an astounding alpine position. Normandy overhangs 20' and stays completely dry even in a steady rain. As do the top rope-able routes directly below on the Lower Cheeks.",

It's inaccurate to say this route gets seasonally dirty.  The fact is the route was never cleaned in the first place.  Not even brushed lightly.  I bolted it and worked it a few times on rope solo then on what was supposed to be an exploratory first lead burn by some complete freak surprise I sent it on my first ever lead attempt.  Believe me, I was more surprised than anyone.  I'd never even tr'd it or gotten it clean on rope solo.  Probably why I didn't think it could possibly be any harder than 12- .  Ok, so I was wrong about that!  I just got lucky.  Today I would say 12+. Since I had a bunch of other projects going at the time I just moved on.  To say that it's dirty or scaly by Index or really pretty much any standard simply denotes a lack of appreciation for actually how clean a route that it is.  How often(especially at Index these days) do you get to simply slam in some bolts, then without any real cleaning just get right to the climbing? It's funny that someone would complain about it being dirty and needing more traffic to clean it up but then not even put forth the minimal amount of effort to pull a few leafy greens out of the crack.  What do you expect? It's in pretty decent shape as of today.  If anyone wants to go de-scale what little isn't on pristine flawless Index granite be my guest.

Small offset cams are useful for the start of p2, especially if you are inclined to sew it up to avoid falling on your partner at the hanging belay.

Unfortunately, there are several other routes in the area that deserve similar attention. As far as Clay is concerned, when the route was established there was one marginal bolt that you clipped just because it was there. No fixed nuts existed. Placing your own gear was mandatory, which in my opinion is a real part of the overall climbing experience. I\u2019ve always been proud of Clay because of the mental and physical demands it required. Clay was certainly one of the most committing and fulfilling routes I\u2019ve ever done. Adding bolts to established natural routes only degrades them to the standards of a climbing gym. Sad.

I am 5'8\" and my partner is 5'10\" and neither of us could reach the bolt at the crux from the obvious \"clipping undercling\" (we were several inches away.) Luckily, you can place a bomber brass nut while on this undercling. You could try to clip the bolt from your next stance, but it will still be very difficult to reach (The move is full wingspan and harder than 5.10- ... but do keep in mind that the climb is a one-move wonder) Anyways, it definitely works to haul on your nut to get that bolt clipped if you are under 6 feet tall... or you could just clip using the climb's crux hold!

To the right of this flake notice the ledge going across to the right, about 20-feet up. (The ledge become a large ramp on the right-most side where it intersects the hillside.) The first pitch starts at the two-bolt anchor about 1/3 of the way across this ledge.    To reach the start, you have a few choices. The easiest is to hike up the trail to the left of the ledge and then walk out the ledge. Some parties may not want a rope to get to the bolted anchor, but if the ledge is wet, it might be nice to have a short belay.   P1: (5.8+) Climb up the corner past a bolt to a long ledge. Traverse to the left end of the ledge, where you will find a bolted belay by the tree. Uses face and layback moves plus the occasional jam. Protects well with nuts and cams.   P2: (5.9) Continue directly up the corner and then up an easier flake section. This pitch can take big gear to protect the easier section, but cams to 3\" would be fine for those comfortable at the grade. The moves between the corner and the crack/flake above can be hard.   P3: (5.9)Head left and then up a crack to bolts at the top.    A fun variation is to follow the crack up and right from the belay (Heart of the Country, 10b).    Descent: Rap the route. You can reach the ground from the top of the second pitch with 2 60-m ropes.",

Most people follow the line of \"Fools Gold\" after climbing the wide crack or flaring corner which is what is described above.  HOTC pitch one actually goes as Scott W described above, traversing right. Here's where it gets good: the 3 old bolts were chopped and 3 replacement bolts placed in locations that protect better.  The moss and lichen have been cleaned off and what was underneath is FANTASTIC ! Gear & Beta: You can safely lead the left side of the flake with one or two #6's or just add some 5.4 runout spice. Alternatively you could climb the flaring corner with off fists and grunt to the top of the flake. Loop the top of the flake then continue on some balancy moves past 3 bolts trending right.  Protect the undercling and move up.  The moves from here are not as reachy as described by Scott W, but only because we removed all the moss and lichen discovering some workable holds.  A person from our party is 5'1\" and she did it static.  The beauty about it is if you blow the crux, you WILL GET AIR . Have some hand size gear for the anchor.  From there, continue up the crux pitch or ramble over to the GM corner anchors for an easier path to the top. In its current state, I would give HOTC p1 a rating of 3.75 out of 4 stars.  I drop it from 4 stars only because it requires some really big gear for protection that not everyone has.  Go borrow your buddies #6's and get up this climb!

A #4 and a bolt protect the bottom of the flake.  If you don't have a #6, the runout up the flake doesn't feel too heady because the lieback is low-angle, 5.4 climbing and once at the top of the flake you can throw a long sling over the tip  to protect the move to the next bolt. The balancey face/slab moves in the middle feel about .10- and the bolts are right where you want them. When you get the finish, you can place a couple finger-sized cams (I also used a red metolius) in the horizontal before stepping up to try for the slap onto the ledge.  I think this move is a dyno for most, but for shorter folks there are a few intermediate edges you can use to stretch up to the ledge.  (Using the thumbpress on the right is key, for me, at least, to be able to stretch enough for my left fingertips to reach the top.)  Hard to give it a grade because it is so reach dependent, but at my height it feels .10c. Your gear will be below your feet when you make this move and gets further away as you hand-traverse the ledge around to the right in order to pull up onto the small boulder on the ledge.  If the prospect of falling during this sequence spooks you, climb P1 of GM first, clip the anchor, step around the corner to climbers left, place a .75 or #1 in the horizontal above the ledge, and suspend a few slings connected together over the ledge.  This will allow you the option of clipping something to protect the finish. Aug 31, 2016",

From the ledge, clip a bolt and climb up and right into a fun and juggy flake (.10) which takes great finger-sized gear. After the flake ends, a few bolts lead past a very tenuous crux crimping on perfect stone, with a few hero jugs over the roof to the chains.This pitch used to have a huge railroad spike bashed into a pocket up high (a drilled angle piton on steroids) and girth hitched for pro- this has been removed and replaced with a normal bolt. I wonder if the FA team ran out of bolts (or just wanted to save $) and simply walked over to the tracks and robbed the railroad for the final fixed piece.There is an extension which feature an immediate crux (chipped right hand pocket) rated .12b or .12c in the various books, and which then passes a couple more bolts and a remaining railroad spike \"piton\" before anchors up and right. The full version to there would be a 45-50m pitch and is almost certainly very dirty.",

It is a physical journey that is sure to test all of you're granite skills.    P1 5.9: Climb R.O.U.S., a fun, dark bolted chimney.   P2 5.11: The fight begins. Start up the Dark Crystal (Seasonally wet, usually dries in early June), climb to where the original route breaks left. Instead, climb straight up, clip a bolt and pull the roof. A couple boulder moves lead to a pumpy hand traverse. Save a hand size piece of gear for the end.    P3 5.10: Climb the short tricky ar\u00eate of the Dark Crystal. This could easily be linked into P4.   P4 5.12- (5.10+ A0): The pitch of eternal sadness. Break right from the ledge into a shallow right facing dihedral. After a somewhat moderate start, a short but devastatingly granite crux, followed by more easy climbing brings you into the Dihedral.    P5 5.11-: Dubbed the Book of Earth Mother, this pitch offers some of the best corner climbing Index has to offer. Perfect.   P6 5.11d: If the corner didn't get you giddy, this slightly overhung 40 meter pitch leads up the glorious Zebra Headwall. Discontinuous cracks, jugs, and a sloper crux is sure to grab your attention.    P7 5.0: Move belay up and right to the next anchor.    P8 5.11: Climb steep rock to a slab crux. Continue up the slab and pull the fat roof on sexy slopers.    P9 5.9: Fun climbing top's you out on the highest point of The Diamond.    \"Just remember love is life and hate is living death. Treat your life for what it's worth and live for every breath. Looking back I've lived and learned, but now I'm wondering. Here I wait and only guess what this next life will bring\"",

Walk across the ledge to the base of a 100 ft tall crack. Jam your way up the crack to a two bolt anchor. A lot of the upper crack is slammer 2s so save one or two for the upper section. Bring a 70m rope and tie knots in the end for the rap.One safety note on this route is the existence of some hollow and/or loose rock - as of 9/4/23.

Recently gardened to remove a couple offending blackberry vines. Possibly a bit stout at the grade for climbers less familiar with Index style movement. A more complete route pitch description: 1. Take either the bolted line just left of the shallow left facing corner after walking roughly 100' up the treed ramp, or the left facing corner just past it until it joins the bolts. 3/4 of the way up the pitch, either tiptoe your way left up a sloping ramp and then mantle to a ledge, which you will follow back right to the main bolt line or follow the bolts straight up to the anchor with some devious lay backing and a tricky sideways mantle. No gear required. 2. Follow the ledge left to the blocky shallow dihedral, where a line of bolts leads up. When the bolts begin to trend left up the white face (Megalomania), leave them and go straight up into the shallow black corner and climb the beautiful flakes to the next anchor. Draws and and a set of finger sized cams up to 0.75 3. Two options, either the original step left past two bolts, over a small roof, and then back right to the base of the corner, or the new Megalomania option - follow 4 bolts up and right to circumvent the roof, then two bolts back to the base of the beautiful right facing corner. 4. Follow the corner to the anchor. Rap the route with a single 70. It's possible to TR the beautiful arette (Megalomania) just left of the final corner pitch after reaching the final anchors.

The point of aid was at a tree on the second pitch(now gone) and possibly on the traverse pitch since that was how I had to do it when I lead the first time. The crack was filled with dirt and moss. It is now a sweet pitch. After cleaning the corner , traverse and last pitch I solo tope roped it and it was amazing! The corner is awesome this was climbable when Brian and I got to it a few years ago.  The best way to get to the upper part of HBFG right now is by climbing Dike Fight 11d****. Single rack of cams from 000 to 4BD, double the .75 to 3. Runners are helpful but  rack of 12 draws should be enough. Jul 25, 2016",

Each pitch gets better the higher you go. Splitter dihedral to roof on p3 was great, p7 was crazy fun too.  Gear beta is accurate, smallest pro was a couple of blue mastercams or red C3s for the traverse pitch. We were happy with one #4 on p3. P2 - 5.11a/b. We took the bolt line directly above and right of the old tree corner. I felt like this was the crux of the route, but maybe stay far right of the bolt line? P3 - 5.10b/c. Awesome, but the last stretch to the anchor after the roof wasn't the hand jamming party I was expecting. P4 - 5.10b/c. Reachy mantle move off the anchor, then strenuous traverse on slopers with occasional finger locks P5 - 5.9+ or 10a. Fun face climbing on good holds. P6 - 5.10c/d. Getting above the first bolt was tough for me, then it's fun 5.10- P7 - mid 5.10. So good. Easy to get intimated by the big roofs, but once you commit it's a trip to jug town Jul 12, 2017",

One seep on pitch 2 that can mostly be climbed around, otherwise the route is already totally dry. Stout for the grade, but that's par for the course. Definitely took some hangs to unlock some sequences. Would be an impressive onsite. Huge thanks to the developers for another great Diamond route. Apr 22, 2019",

Start up the Dark Crystal (Seasonally wet, usually dries in early June), climb to where the original route breaks left. Instead, climb straight up, clip a bolt and pull the roof. A couple boulder moves lead to a pumpy hand traverse. Save a hand size piece of gear.    P3 5.10: Climb the short tricky ar\u00eate of the Dark Crystal.   P4 5.11d: Break left and follow the obvious rail. Techy, powerful and sustained climbing makes up this all time classic pitch.    P5 5.10-: A short catwalk move brings you into a chimney like feature.   P6 5.10-: Start in the chimney and follow your way up a perfect face climbing following dykes, knobs and jugs.    P7 5.7: A short pitch brings you to the ledge.   P8 5.10+: Follow the corner until it opens up into a hand crack through a roof. Straight in jam you're way up this beauty.

Ideal rack (for me) would be single little purple metolius (for aid), double cams from little blue metolius to #3 BD, and a single #4 BD for P1 of the Dark Crystal.  After that, singles from little blue metolius to #3 BD (for pitches 8 and 9) is totally sufficient but one probably has to lug the extra gear up the traversy crux P4 to be able to easily retrieve on the way down (our rap route went straight down and skipped the P.2 Dark Crystal Anchor).  I'm a big wuss, like to lace stuff up, and was climbing at the edge of my ability (for people trying to gauge appropriate rack size).  Single 70m rope gets you down fine.  An 80 might be handy.  No nuts necessary.  All beautiful fresh double stainless bolt belays with chains. We linked Pitches 2+3 (the Dark Crystal crack and .10+ arete).  This was no issue and avoids an uncomfortable looking belay.  A yellow-grey alien offset would be pretty ninja behind the undercling used to pass the roof before the 1st bolt but definitely isn't necessary (good .2-.4 bd size gear nearby).  I used the purple metolius as an aid piece above the 1st bolt.  It's not necessary if you're confident freeing.  I took and placed a #5 BD on P1 Dark Crystal but it's definitely not necessary (good smaller gear all around). I believe I counted 13 lead bolts on P4 so plan accordingly.  If you're a real baller and have enough draws/slings you may be able to link it with p5 and avoid a semi-hanging belay. We linked Pitches 5+6 (the catwalk/chimney and .10- Juggy dyke).  There ends up being 18 clips if you do this (shuffled carabiners and used cams as quickdraws).  Conscious slinging resulted in minimal rope drag.  Might be better to link 6+7 instead though so your buddy doesn't have to hang out longer at the semi-hanging p4 anchors. We linked pitches 8+9 (last two pitches) and lowered back to the belay ledge with a single 70 and a tiny bit of down- climbing.  Knot your end and/or use an 80 if you do this! One may be able to skip the pitch 5 anchor on the rappel with an 80m rope but a 70 wasn't going to make it. on October 17th the route started going into the shade (from bottom up) at about 1 or 2 pm. We climbed in the heat and got spanked!!  I largely french freed the dark crystal pitch (awesome, burly, technical varied crack with face feet- not off width- stoked to give it another go) , went bolt to bolt on the crux pitch, and felt pretty beat down/slow for the top (ended up rapping by headlamp). Even so, this climb is amazing!  It's varied, clean, quality, and safe!  Great climb for someone trying to push their limits on Index 5.11's.  It's well protected the whole way and fairly easy to french free if you get stuck.  The crux pitch 4 is a real stunner- classic, sustained techy Index face climbing.  No move is harder than Index .11 but there sure are a lot of .11 moves!  I'm stoked to go back in cooler temps and try to link 'em all up! Get on this thing!!! Oct 18, 2018",

The route is climbable year round.P1 5.6 : Climb the first pitch of Hell Bent for Glory.P2 Most likely harder then\u00a05.10+: Continue the first 15 ft of Hell Bent's 2nd pitch, break left at the bolt line. Bolts/Gear.P3 5.11- : Above the belay, climb straight up to a traversing pitch of techy yet powerful climbing that leads to the base of the finger crack. Bolts/GearP4: 5.11- : Follow the long striking finger crack. Thin GearP5 5.10-: Start up the corner system and break right onto face climbing that leads to Eyelid Ledge. Bolts/GearP6 5.10+ : From the belay, follow a ramp and break through the left side of eyelid roof. Fun climbing on highly featured stone. One can skip the rap anchor and belay at the base of the corner on Lovely Lady Ledge. BoltsP7 5.9 : Climb the corner. Break right at the roof and belay atop of the slab.

It was pretty tricky at a couple parts and a little slick. We both fell while figuring out the sequence to the crux. We both also fell on our first attempt to gain the ledge (before the traverse right). The ledge is pretty slopy and we were both already a bit pumped from figuring out the lower part.

Once there, follow the face up to a stance. Here, if you are tall enough you can get a yellow alien in the high crack. If not, you might have to run it out. If so, you're looking at a long fall. It is possible to sling a root at chest height but the FA party didn't so it's up to you. From here, pull the flake with marginal feet up to the next flake, with less marginal feet. Then pull onto the top.Start with a steep leaning hand crack that brings you to a good stance.

You definitely will be happier if you have a variety of small sized cams.  You'll definitely be happier if you have 5-6 runners.  On several of the bolts that protected mantle moves, I clipped both a QD and a runner.  After pulling the move I back cleaned the QD.  Although this sounds unconventional, it protected any ledge falls while pulling the harder moves and then left gear to protect while I moved up easier terrain that didn't create much rope drag.  Alternatively one could used doubled runners, then extend after pulling the move. As for the grade, it's definitely easier if you protect in a manner that reduces drag.  Since I was aware of the potential drag issues and protected the line accordingly, it really did feel like a 5.9.  I watched someone climb it later that only used QD's to protect it and it for sure looked like it made for a grade or two increase in effort and difficulty.  So HOW one protects this one really affects its subjective grade significantly.  If one were to climb this on TR, the grade would feel spot on. Highly Recommended and a good line to go up if you want to try to TR Geek Corner. Aug 16, 2018",

BETA: Begin on moderate climbing on blocky holds trending rightwards to a bomber heel hook below the 2nd bolt. After clipping the 3rd bolt, throw out right to a big pinch and then up to a small 3 finger crimp. Match the good horizontal hold at bolt 4 and throw right to a small side pull, then out left to the arete where a jug resides. Rest up on the big jug below the roof and then a hard sequence with an undercling in a horizontal crack out right to the arete. Enjoy the last good rest at the base of the twin cracks and gear up for the pumpy finish. After pulling up onto the sloppy ledge at bolt 9, save some energy in the tank for the \"heartbreaker\" crux. Using compression, liebacking and finger locks will put you at the hero jug out left. Top out and take in an interesting view of the inner walls.   5.11 is not my intended grade because my intent is to leave this route is ungraded.

So I swing over from humpback humpback humpback to see if I can free the rope as our friend was sorta stuck on toprope down low hanging off a cam so I could have slack to work with.  It took me 5 minutes, working literally where the rope was wedged to get the sucker out.  It was reaalllly in there, no idea how it managed to fit into a crack half its size, but luckily rope wasnt damaged.

If my memory serves me correct that was the intended clipping stance but I also think people could still clip a move or two prior. I placed the bolt low intentionally so everyone can easily clip. The second bolt is thoughtfully where it is to 1: be far enough left out of the way of Foodbar to not compromise its style, 2: be far enough right of the corner to prevent a bad pendulum into the corner if the hard move is missed, and 3: simply only protect the move to the jug.

The climb presents some interesting challenges to us shorter climbers (I'm 5'1\"), but stick clipping the first bolt and plugging in a piece or two before the second clip (I used a .5BD and a blue Alien) keeps you safe where you are trying hard.  If you don't have a long enough reach, the crux will seem desperate and a lot harder than.10b, but the bolt is right at your waist so there's no harm in giving it your best shot. It took me a few tries and takes but I eventually found a way to get my feet higher on the left to eek out just enough of a lunge to get my fingertips behind the jug.  Another good gear placement appears immediately after you pull up. The wide crack/stem box continues the fun.  You can walk a #4 about 1/2 way up.  Take a #5 for the top of this wide section if you want to keep things chill. I'll definitely be back for another go at this one. Single rack to #5 was plenty sufficient for gear.

You might be better off belaying on the trail below and climbing a short right-facing mossy corner to the base, but then you have pretty serious ledge-fall potential past the crux. \"Splitter hand crack\" = slightly overhung lieback flake, takes .75s down to fingers. Bolted crux moves are STOUT, or maybe I have bad beta. 11c seems spot on even for Index.

On p2 there are the thin flakes that are in the crack in few different spots on the pitch. They are flexing and im concerned they might break. After turning the roof section the thin flakes there are cool pinches and would suck if they broke. I have a plan to fix them with epoxy. Have the material up there to do it, l just need to make the time. And i have two more hangers to put back on the pitch 4 traverse. Nov 5, 2017",

The old way is to go straight, passing west of the boulder then uphill through some forest and talus for another 5 minutes to a T junction. Head right. Continue for 5-10 minutes, trending right to the base of Private Idaho. The trail traverses along the base of Private Idaho. (If you miss the turnoff to Private Idaho then when the talus hits the wall, go right and traversing along the base of Lookout Point (just above Private Idaho), then you will eventually reach a gully. Hag Crag is at the bottom of this gully, just to the east.) \u00a0If you take the earlier right turn at the talus, then traverse to the end of this wall where there is the popular \u00a0Senior Citizens in Space corner crack. Keep going up and right to the next wall and you are there.Since 2019 there has been a quicker trail that goes directly to Hag. At Midnite, take the right turn just in front of the boulder and head east along the meandering trail. Pass some boulders, cross a small talus field, and then go up past two short bluffs (the upper one has a waterfall in winter and spring).

Expect a lot of great palming, excellent friction climbing and some intricate but delightful traverse sequences. Maybe a little over bolted, but I clipped them all so I can really complain. The only thing keeping this route from being 4 stars imo is the fact that the good climbing is only about 15m of the 30ish meter pitch.

The route seems to leave quite an impression on folks, either they love it or they hate it (this might reflect on which side they had their feet).On a hot day, you might find this one of the coolest routes in the district.One can do a variation that traverses out onto the slab before the chimneying section, clipping three bolts to a lower anchor. Or, one can do the extended finish, going to the top (5.8), though this might presently be difficult to protect except at the start.Shares the same start as On the Rebound.There is a walk-up anchor at the top, about 25' above the old anchor for this route.

It is a big reach. Some may have to dyno for it. And if you are under 5' tall, it may be physically impossible to make the reach.

Before passing the Midnite boulder, turn right down the Trilium trail. Continue for a few minutes until you see a small trail heading right down a winding path to the base of the wall. At the time of this writing there's an orange sign that says 'Happy Halloween' on a tree with 3 trunks pointing to the right towards the trail, but it's a little hard to see. Follow this winding trail for a few minutes to meet the base of the wall. As you walk across the trail, you will pass along the top of the Leaky Cauldron.

One could take this route as a way to eliminate some hiking to to reach parts of Planet Index or to reach other pitches on Lookout, but it is not a route to be rushed. It is fun, for one thing, but more importantly, one must be extremely careful not to knock loose rocks down.\u00a0It can be pitched out many ways, and certainly possible to combine pitches, though probably good to plan on about nine pitches. Here's a breakdown of the way we pitched it out (also look at the images here and topo in the guide) and rough difficulty ratings:\u00a0p1: Tight squeeze chimney for about 10', followed by some laybacking to a very large, spacious ledge. You should belay here, just because it is a nice ledge. The start should be pretty obvious, though also note the bolt here on the face for the belayer. (9+)\u00a0p2: Follow flakes right to a large crack, then back left to another large ledge. Belay at the anchor near the cedar tree. (8)\u00a0p3: Go up and right into the chimney-flake feature. Continue up to the base of Lou's slab and belay just above a tree. (7 or 8, depending on finish) \u00a0\u00a0p4: \"The little climb that could, wonders if it still can\". Walk, jam, and layback up a ramp-ledge that goes up and right to the ledge at the base of Velvet Pedestal (p2) and Say When. (4)\u00a0p5: Go up the start of Say When to a point where you can traverse right to the belay at the top of the And Say finger crack. Do not stop here, but keep traversing, passing one bolt, then resume climbing up at a flake to another bolt and another traverse right ending at the Bus House ledge. (8)\u00a0p6: Go up the wide crack, then either belay at the anchor (for top of crux finger crack of Solitude) and then walk up the handline to Solitude cave, or simply go directly to Solitude cave. Go through the cave to Buckminster's Palace. (8+)p7: (We actually broke this up into two, though for hot days you may want to combine these two to avoid a sun-baked belay at the last Solitude belay) Go up a rib feature past one bolt, following a broken corner, then step left for a short face section past a bolt. Just above is the last Solitude belay. You might skip that and continue up the corner to a roof. Finger traverse right, then clip a high bolt, and continue traversing until reaching a crack going up and right. Face climb on big holds and step right to trees. This puts you on Red Tile Camp. (9+)\u00a0p8: Walk along the treed ledge to the anchor with a runner. Climb up the face to the bolt. This start is the same as LOPD (p3). Upon reaching the small roofs, instead of going left, go over the roofs. Then traverse right to an anchor at the base of a short slab. (9+)\u00a0p9: Go up the broken corner and flakes, then follow the short slabby ramp up and right. There is a short handline here to a tree at the top. (4)",

Walk up to the wall and walk right until you see a bolt at head height next to a chimney between the wall face and a big boulder P1 - the start is one of the hardest moves in the whole thing. The squeeze closes at the top, which makes it hard to mantle. Made it to a bolted anchor P2 - quite dirty. The upper section is poorly protected, so ended up running it out to the upper ledge. Walk left to the cedar tree with a bolted anchor P3/P4 - chill walk through the flake. You might want to skip the first big tree and instead link with P4 which walks up the ramp to the second big tree at the bottom of the \"Say When\" hand crack. Built an anchor on the tree P5 - go up the obvious \"Say When\" hand crack. About 20 ft up the slab creates a ledge to traverse right. A bit spooky traverse with big exposure and down-sloped slab edges until you get to a flake. Up to the big tree. Built an anchor on the tree P6 - offwidth chimney squeeze! Took off all the gear on my right side and tucked my entire body in. Shimmy up, pure friction style. It is unprotectable for about 10 feet until you can get in a 3\" or 4\" in a chockstone flake. The hard part is transitioning the squeeze from the boulder to the flake. Mantle up to a big tree where you can build an anchor to haul up backpacks up OR walk past for about 15 feet to a bolted anchor. You can see the cave up and left from here. You can just walk through the cave and there is a bolt on the outward face just right of the exit. Built an anchor on the bolt P7 - there were 2 fixed lines. One is very long and goes up and left. The other is short and up high on the right face. We took the rib up until the first roof. From here you should traverse right to the highly visible big tree. Dont make the mistake of continuing up and left past the first roof to the second roof and climbing right - this is much harder than the grade. Built an anchor on the tree P8 - walked through the treed ledge until we got to an anchor with a cleaning station hanging between the bolted anchor P9 - up and right of the anchor is a bolt. Clipped the bolt. Up above there was a sort of V roof with a bolt on the boulder right below. We made it up to the bolt. Aided through the mantle and then into a belly crawl. We were later told this is much harder than the intended route in the comments - apparently you walk right to a dead tree and keep going right to reach the \"real\" P9 anchor at the base of a short slab. After the crawl, we walked up and into a roof below the flagpole block. Made a gear anchor under the roof. From here you can walk down to the ledge, follow the rusty cable up and climber's left to the flagpole. To descend, walk the towards the woods. Before you step up onto the boulder, where the trail continues into the woods, look right for a murky climbers trail that takes a steep descent into the gully. Take this down to the base. Its steep but has nice steps and never felt unsafe. Jul 15, 2024",

This part has no pro, but is relatively easy. Then clip a short cable draw (homemade) hanging just below the roof \u00a0and start traversing along the good edge. I tested a fall before clipping the second bolt and found the swing to be fine, though probably best not to jump back too much or you could swing into the tree (also be aware of the lower ledge). After mounting the roof-ledge, follow the crack trending left with excellent nut slots and then use the cracks just above for your last pieces. Finish by going back right to a the tree at the edge.

After an intermediate chained anchor (~50 ft up; do not belay here), you soon arrive at a wide platform known as \"Rojo\". From Rojo, you have two choices, both nice and clean cracks going to the same ledge 30' above, and both about 5.9. \u00a0a) On the left side, a right-leaning offset hand-to-finger crack. b) On the right side, a finger-crack and layback that first trends right, then left. \u00a0Both end on a sloping ledge with a chained belay anchor.P2: 10a. Go left to the tree. Then start this pitch one of two ways. 1) Traverse left on the slab below the bolt. Then move up. 2) Go up and left along the crack and hand traverse above the bolt. This way avoids the bolt. Both ways join after the traverse. Climb past a second bolt up to a small overlap.Follow the cracks up and left. Good friction on the slabs, but no real footholds, so it may get pumpy. Chained anchor on the ledge above.\u00a0P3: 5.8. Several ways. If you belay at the anchor for the top of P2, take the first way: from the right edge of the ledge, follow the pair of cracks to a ramp feature that takes you to the corner. Near the start, you could clip a high bolt on the face, though it is probably not needed. (That bolt is for a face route \"City Bobcat\".) Then just follow the corner (5.7-5.8).\u00a0If you move your belay over to the base of the corner (next ledge to the right), then you can either start at the base of the corner and do thin laybacking or stemming for the first 20' (at ~5.10) and then continue up the corner as with the first way. An intermediate way is to start here at the base of the corner, but undercling out left to bypass the difficult laybacking-stemming section (~5.9).\u00a0Also, a direct face-crack finish to the right is possible (5.10). Veer off right of the main corner for the last 30' and go straight up. This is the variation \"...Sounding the Alarm\".\u00a0Decent:\u00a0Several rap anchors exist near the top. From the top of the pedestal, a 70 m might make it to the p2-3 anchor. With two 70s, you can rap directly to the base of p2, and take a few options down from there.",

I did all the moves on this with Tom and Sunshine and one other friend I forget his name. Tom didn't try it though so I didn't get a good insight as to the rating. For example Sunny climbed Bobcat without any problem and then the steep corner on TIINLA has a big reach move and that gave her a challenge. I'm guessing 12 b/c for TIINLA.

Also, what gear you use will depend for sure on how you climb it (where you punch it and where you stop to place). For your first go, I'd recommend offset nuts, brassies, purple C3, doubles from purple metolius to .5, singles from .75-2... and whatever else you need/want to get up to the first chains. If you're onsighting, the burden of the extra weight will be offset by the boon of having many choices. If you don't send, you can refine the beta as suits your climbing style.

Climb a short crack on a pedestal, about 30' left of Peanuts. At the top of the pedestal, layback up and right to the face holds (takes a good wired stopper or brass nut: #5 BD nut is perfect). The face climbing (~5.8) has two bolts, and ends on a ledge below a hand-crack in a shallow corner. Climb the crack (~10a) and do a few traverse moves left to a two-bolt chained anchor below the roof.Older guidebooks erroneously showed the flaring corner just below p2 as the first pitch. Now that corner is clean, so it makes an alternative first pitch (in summer and fall, anyway--it tends to stay wet in winter & spring). Some folks now start on it, then veer right about 20' up to join the standard p1 described above.\u00a0P2: 5.10d. Go over the roof on the right side, grabbing solid flakes and jamming (~10a). Enter the corner (see photo) and follow the corner to a ledge and 3-bolt belay. The crux is the pumpy jams soon after pulling the roof. The crack widens at the top. The top ledge is very comfortable. This second pitch stays clean, and has slightly curvy and colorful rock. Sustained corner jamming. It also tends to be drier than nearby routes, even in a light rain.A double rope (150') reaches the ground. With a single rope, you can rap to the anchor at the top of the first pitch, but it may require a little swinging to be able to grab the chains. From this anchor, a single 60-m rope will reach the ground.",

And how about a fixed line leading to the base of Relapse? That would be a nice alternative to having to traverse in from B to B I think. And for sure remove your original anchor from P1 of Relpase. That flake it is perched on is scary anyway and the moves go direct through the crystal pockets. If I could do them in that heat, they might be only 11c or so in cooler temps. Put one bolt to clip when your hand is in the sloping right pocket, another to clip after you've stood up with your foot in it, another to clip once you grab the small positive knob above (which is about level with the small roof/flake to the right or maybe a little higher), and then another to clip once you get your foot on that knob to rejoin the part that Jon did.

A C4 #5 was nice to have to protect the start of the layback flake. Some additional information to help you find it: Hike as if heading to Private Idaho, taking the first well-defined trail to the right after passing the boulder and heading uphill.  Where this trail forks and heading right would take you over to the base of Private Idaho, go left and uphill following the trail into a drainage/gully.

PTSY is just below and to the left.  Scramble up the gully left of the base of the route and traverse right along the ledge to the start of the route. Alternatively, you can approach from the base of Private Idaho by walking to the far right side of the crag and continuing along the trail to Hag Crag.  From the left side of Hag Crag, a trail heads up to Lookout Point, leading you to the base of Steel Pulse.  From Steel Pulse, follow the trail left (downhill) along the base of the cliff.  Coming from this direction, the clean crack of PTSY should be obvious.  All in all only a few minutes hike from the base of Senior Citizens in Space to the base of PTSY. Jun 18, 2009",

I don't think any move harder then 11a. I took a fall trying to get up to the corner I think where in the picture someone describes as 10b crux. I was about 6' above a #3, layback up a blunt downturned flake. I was not seeing any pro available, tried to reverse the moves, slipped and ran down the slab. It has some insecure pulling on features, which is more intimidating then hard. Once I got back up roof on left I discovered a hidden left slot that makes pulling up to the pedestal with finger crack above much easier, A #4 protects below this .

It is at the very top of Lookout Point, and finishes right at the apex as viewed from town, which is left (west) of the flagpole.    Face climb up to the shallow right-facing corner/flake/roof feature, following the line of bolts. The first move is about 10+ or 11-. Upon reaching the top of this feature, follow the thin, rounded crack left across the face. The crack widens and turns the corner, becoming thin hands. The technical crux is the start of the crack, but the real crux is maintaining enough strength to reach the thin hands. There are only the merest of knobs for the feet. End at chains.",

I am not sure if anyone else had sent this yet ( hard to believe I was the first) but I'd say .11+ rather than .12-, though if you are quite short, the feet you get will be much worse through the crux.

But the small proto-knobs up higher might be better for the shorter climber. So, it may just about balance out for short and tall climbers. I agree about the suggested bolt move. Perhaps not super critical though, as it is not in a desperate spot. Derek and I have considered a different finish that goes further left, onto the steeper headwall.

For example, it took me less time to stick the crux on Narrow Arrow Direct than on this pitch - but I guess that's just me...  Then again, the traversing crack was also unclimbably dirty when I got to it, and I spent a couple hours cleaning it on rappel before attempting to free it on mini-trac.  Since you can't get in pro the whole way, cleaning was quite the effort, often involving tensioning out with one hand on a cam and brushing vigorously with the other arm completely extended.

At the top, clip your first bolt and move right and up to a ledge. This is the crux move (~10a). Then go up the groove above, clipping only the ratty 1/4\" bolt on the rib (~5.8+).\u00a0Soon after this route was put up, a variation finish \"Anarchy and Chaos\" was added that goes up the thin crack up and left of the first bolt.In 2012, about five bolts were added to the bottom groove and the large corner continuation of the bottom groove was cleaned out, creating a nice corner variation. Since this occurred, the route suddenly became much more popular.\u00a0In 2019, the two lower aretes to the right of this pitch and the upper arete to the left were bolted, creating several arete-climbing variations (left: Sleepy Sparrow; right: Sisara). These bolts should not be clipped if doing the original line or corner variation as they would create rope drag and are not needed for protection.\u00a0Several possibilities exist for climbing further pitches to the top:\u00a0For a 5.10 finish, take L&O pitch 2 or Ship Called Black Rock, then LOPD p3 to the top. \u00a0For a 5.9 finish, go right on one of the cracks towards the base of the Black Rock corner, but continue about 10' further right to the corner (7-8).

I've done both variations: The \"Left hand variation\" protects the best, and is a fun layback ending in a 1- bolt traverse back to the right. The \"right hand variation\" uses small pro (brass offset), maybe pg13 and graded maybe 5.9 and a little dirty, could use a bolt, maybe. I like the left variation the best!  The only move on the left hand variation that may feel spooky is a couple face moves getting to the layback, but maybe the face moves are 5.8.  The layback is maybe 10a/5.9 depending where you climb and protects something like this: smaller gear (green or blue basic totem/alien), red basic totem, red basic totem, yellow basic totem/alien. Note about rapping:  It's pretty easy to get down, via different routes or downclimb or tree 2nd rap.  I agree with Jon. Another anchor is NOT needed.  I like the one where it is!  What a fun 40m-45m or maybe 50m long climb! Apr 30, 2016",

Later, we found that you could instead do the less seepy first pitch of House of the Seventh Bobcat, then traverse left into the vertical crack of p2.Pitch 2 traverses right (5.10) to a short, nearly vertical crack that bends right and stops at the top (5.9). Reach from the top of the crack over to the corner crack at right and then head straight up towards the looming chimney above. Climb the chimney and belay on top at a bolted anchor. If it is very hot, you can drop down into the \"rat hole\" behind the flake for cooler shade.\u00a0Pitch 3 goes directly up from the belay along a crack system that becomes a right-facing corner. Follow this hands-and-finger crack in the RFC as it curves right and ends. Be sure to use long slings on this section as you must turn the corner past the roof and layback up a rounded edge (5.11a), forcing the rope to go over the roof. Belay above on the sloping ledge.\u00a0If you want to top out, do a short pitch up through the trees to a belay at a final headwall. Climb the face past a bolt, trend left below a bulge to reach a short RFC with some finger jams to an awkward mantle. You can clip a bolt just below this crux RFC and also clip a bolt just after mantling.

That part of Dukes is listed as \"5.9\" in the old topos, but we think others would rate it 5.9+. The ledge above, \"Duke's Ledge\", is large and comfy with a chained anchor.

Listed here are probably the easiest for most parties.\u00a0p1: Start on a series of steps going up a ramp. The steps stop, but there is a good layback edge on the right wall to make it easy for you to walk your feet up the ramp. At the top of the ramp is a short bulge with two cracks. Take the crack on the right. This bulge, and the crack just above it, is the crux \u00a0I thought that stemming around it kept the difficulty at 5.7, though others think it is an 8 or 9 (and may do it differently). The cracks both trend towards a wide crack. Upon reaching the wide crack, cut back right towards the big ledge. Ends at a ledge with rap anchor about 40' below the level of Law & Order ledge.p2: Go straight up the thin crack that improves. A short ways up join \"Dukes ledge\", then trend left, then back right following the main crack. Ends at another big ledge. Probably 5.9.\u00a0p3: Continue up the corner system to a bulge. Go right around the bulge (5.9 awkward, though solid jams) and up, trending left to a large ledge system above other routes. At the crux bulge, place gear carefully to reduce chances of a ledge fall.\u00a0If you wish to top out (highly recommended), continue up to the wooded ledge and belay here, if rope drag permits. This pitch is probably the crux.Topping out: Take LOPD p4 up the face past four bolts and gear to a treed ledge right below the flagpole. This pitch meanders a little, so use long slings on some pieces. From here, you can walk around or select from a few very short pitches directly up to the flagpole (more fun this way).\u00a0Along the way, there are numerous opportunities to connect up with other routes including Dukes, Steel Pulse, Law & Order, Black Rock, as well as numerous variations.",

Fairly non-intimidating (low angle, big holds, \u00a0plentiful gear, and easy escapes to nearby gully), so probably a good beginner multipitch experience.\u00a0The route goes into the shade in the afternoon, so it can be a relatively cool outing on hot days. Also, the first two pitches tend to dry quickly after rain.As it it new, leaders in the first parties on it should probably bring a nut tool to scrape dust & debris out of some placements. Each pitch described below has several possible variations. \u00a0p1 (5.5): Start with some slightly left-trending face to reach a low-angle ramp at the base of a right-facing corner. Jam, layback, or face climb up this corner, which is the crux of the pitch. The crack bends up left while simultaneously becoming a blocky rib. Enjoy grabbing jug after jug on this section, and practice placing nuts (lots of excellent slots). Stay on the left side of the rib. At the ledge on top of the rib, clip the bolt and traverse up and left on a rail to join a jumble of flakes that become the Jolly Pockets ledge. Belay on the right side, closest to the gully. 60m to 65mp2 (~5.5-5.8): Go up the splitter crack ( ~5.5) then friction right at the bulge. Overcome the bulge on the right side, then trend up and left to an anchor. (For the bulge, if you go all the way to the right, then you are going around it, making it 4th class. But if you go over at the crack, it is harder than 5.5, probably about 5.7 to 5.8.)p3 (~5.5): Not the prettiest pitch, but it gets you to the top. For this pitch, you have to cross a groove-gully of poor-quality rock near the start. But if you go up first on solid, but easy, slab to the roof and then go right, you can essentially step over the bad section on a ramp. (Avoid the temptation to instead go directly right from the belay or you will face the sketchy rock.) \u00a0Once on the ramp, you have a choice of two cracks. Both take you to a sloping ledge below a roofy section. Avoid the roofy section (if you want, or take the obvious hand crack through it) by going left to the anchor then up on stacked flakes to a steep ramp going up and right, above the roofy section. There is an anchor just above, but to reach the top, go right and up the ramp to the apex. There is sometimes a handline coming down this ramp. \u00a0The belay is just over the apex. The handline takes you to the summit pine forest and flagpole.",

Also if you were curious about rappelling (walking off the gulley isn't your thing or you forgot walk off shoes (me)) - you can rap all 3 pitches with a 70 m, though for the last rap you need to use the lower handline anchor, and it deposits you on the ledge before the layback slab on pitch one (simple walk or scramble down from there) and is a rope stretcher. Tie your knots. Could also do it in 4 raps all the way to the ground with the final rap being off the Fallen Stars anchor. Sep 15, 2023",

Finding a new moderate multipitch at Index is rare. And with a flagpole summit! Anyone know the history on the 1922 carving by the flagpole? The first two pitches were a mix of Squamish's Klahanie crack and Senior Citizens style climbing. Super fun! The third pitch wasn't that bad. It had decent gear even through the \"choss\". It wasn't choss so much as just a bit of water polishing where I had to do some friction stemming. The only really bad thing was pitch four to the summit. No matter which way you go from the belay below the roof, you have to climb past, or detour around two 4 foot wide stacked flakes. They are not well attached. Hopefully a heavy snowfall will bring them down. That last ramp up and around the headwall on pitch 4 had an old handline. I was glad it was there as I could find no pro. If we'd had more time I would have loved to lead directly to the summit via either the 4 inch crack or the hand jam to it's left, those both looked awesome! Oct 1, 2024",

The route follows the old A3 Steel Pulse aid line that goes left where the standard free Steel Pulse goes right.\u00a0From the low SP anchor, step up left on a large hold to peer into the LF (left-facing) corner and place a piece or two. You can place an excellent small nut at the bottom with an opposition piece and also a black totem a foot higher. The corner jams are fun shallow hands and fingers. Near the end of the crack you can place a few large (~1/2\") stoppers and then clip a low anchor. To here, it is ~10a/b. (You should be able to lower or rap down from here with a 70 m, but we did not check.)\u00a0Instead, continue up the corner as it turns into an arching overlap that bends left to the Barking Bobcat RF corner. A hard-to-see rail off left helps you to stem up and find ways to grab the super grippy overlap. There are four bolts here, and after reaching the second, you can aid past the crux. After the friction traverse left, you might want to have a small wired stopper before stepping up into the Barking B corner. This corner is nice thin hands and fingers that take you to just below the anchor.\u00a0To toprope:Toproping can be done without leading a route, though would either require two ropes, a belay from above, or a rap down to the SP/V7M anchor. Reach the top by hiking around the east end and up the gully to the triple cedar tree. Use the access line to safely reach the Joly Pocket ledge and move along the handline west, doing a short ~15' rap on the fixed line to the chained anchor and ledge. Probably easier to just lead it. If you can make it to the second bolt after the mid-anchor, aiding the rest of the crux is easy with an alpine sling as the remaining bolts are very close.",

Recently entire new routes a have been bolted over old routes. (Argentinosaurus) Routes have been squeezed into locations where bolts were added to decades old trad leads.

Follow this splitter as it widens to hands and goes to the top. The rock is really grippy and the angle is fairly low, so it may make for excellent practice at finger-to-hand jamming for the new trad climber. Old trad climbers like it too.\u00a0As others have pointed out, this is easily linked with a pitch below. But if you have the time, belay at Buzz's where you can more easily watch your partner enjoy the jams. \u00a0A little story about the name. On our last walk together in her old neighborhood, my mom and I got into counting dandelions in the yards we passed. Her counting was very slow, but that was fine with me as the number of dandelions were low, typically 10 or less per yard. Yet there was this one yard at the corner that I thought we should avoid, seeing as it appeared to have thousands. Somehow though, we did get to that yard, and we did start counting. As the numbers climbed, I started to feel a bit anxious. And then, a miracle: once my mom hit 24, she just said \"Well, I suppose there are more than 24 there.\"",

It starts just above \"Milkman\" and can easily be linked with that pitch.\u00a0To toprope or rap in without climbing to the route's base (and get down w/o rapping), you can approach by either side of Planet Index.\u00a01) Hike up the steep gully between Lookout Point and Planet Index. At the top, follow the trail straight back north that soon bends right. In about 20 paces, a side-trail branches off right and stays near the top of Planet Index. Follow to the obvious top to Lookout jr.\u00a02) Near the base of the above gully, and below Daddy Wall, go right on the trail along the base of The Towers. Follow the sometimes faint trail up the hillside just east of Planet Index. When you are level with the top of Lookout jr, cut left, directly over to the top. If you miss this, you go up and over a rise before hitting the side-trail mentioned in 1) above.Also, see the topo in the topo guide.",

This trail goes to Private Idaho, Rattletale, Lookout Point, Duck Wall, the Diamond, as well as some popular boulders.The trail meanders through deep forest, heading up to a crest. At this crest, the trail left goes to Zelda boulders, but the main trail goes right and remains fairly level until reaching Midnite boulder. Just before this boulder, a trail to Hag goes off right. The main trail passes left of this boulder, then starts ascending through wooded talus. Soon thereafter is a T-junction; the trail to the left goes to Rattletale (and a way to Duck Wall & the Diamond), the trail to the right goes to Private Idaho, Hag Crag, Lookout Point, Duck Wall & the Diamond area. After a few more minutes of ascending overgrown talus, a trail takes off right (just below the 'Brad Driscoll' outcrop). This trail skirts below Private Idaho and provides access to all of the routes.",

Maybe a lower anchor at the end of the significant difficulties would make sense, too? Aug 29, 2022",

It\u2019s both an easier route at the crag, and splitter at that, as well as a great route to practice what are typically more frustrating jams for most-that is if you stick straight into the main crack and forego the right side crack.

What a treat for those who enjoy challenges and/or enjoy/want to get better at OW.

We had a sixty meter rope and not much was left on the ground when my partner got to the anchors. The climbing is widely varied, from snarky little finger jams to double hand stacks.

Also, I couldn't see any protection in the seam on the other side of the ledge, although I didn't get close enough to inspect properly. Overall, the climbing was definitely interesting and exciting up to the ledge mantle and was fairly well bolted up to that point. My advice is that any 5.10 thin crack climbers who think this will be just another crack climb with a spicy mantle (a la Princely Ambitions) should take some time to practice sporty mantles before attempting this climb.

As far as free climbing is concerned, consider this an open project. Be aware that a boulder pad or three is probably better protection than any of the gear you're going to get until the apex of the arch.   Pitch 2 (A2) -   From the bolted anchor at the top of pitch 1, bat hook right to a series of upward facing flakes, then head up the thin seam from the bolt, many beaks placement but some pods for solid clean gear too, ends at a bolted anchor just before the large treed ledge.

Continue up the crack to an anchor up high, which may be hard to see until you get closer.The top may be a little dirty, but if this route cleans up a little bit its a pretty classic finger crack. Bring a brush and do something nice!Also, there is a handline up the gully just west of Hot Curly that gives easy access to the anchors. So, it is easy to set up a TR on this crack. (As of early July, this gully is a bit clogged with debris from above, but should be cleaned up soon.

After pulling over the little rooflet in the middle of the route, stay left and your next bolt will appear after the dark, left-facing flake.  From here, stay left for your next bolt (the bolt you see to your right is on Smilodon) and a few more fun moves that will take you to the Smilodon anchor without clipping any of that routes bolts. Since these two routes share a 3-bolt anchor, please be mindful of how you arrange your anchor so as to leave space for climbers to lead or TR both lines simultaneously.  If people are finding this shared station to be a hazard or a hassle,  we may revisit the anchor bolt arrangement in the future.  Establishing an independent anchor on the left for Anthropocene could put the rappel line in the territory of the massive detached flakes, which is why it is where it is now. Also, a quick note regarding the grade: depending on how short or tall you are and whether you stay to the right or left the bolt line at the cruxes,  the route can feel anywhere from 5.8+ to .10a.  Choose your own adventure.  The bolts are placed with the intent to make this an interesting and safe climb (ie-- to avoid ledge falls and discourage folks from using the mossy, semi-detached blocks on the left), so feel free to try hard if this grade range is at your limit or enjoy it as warm-up approach pitch of Argentinosaurus.

Although it was listed in the early Clint Cummins guide, it was labeled as the wrong climb.  The later Cramer guide showed the correct, but otherwise forgotten line.  The most recent Kalman/VanBiene guide appropriately ignored the line.  As of 2019, there was a scary anchor and plenty of tat to mark the path of terror one would follow to complete the line. During the winter of 2019, Gabe Webster and I tried to resurrect the line \u201cCongolindination\u201d.  In the process of removing loose rock, we pretty much removed most of the first half of the climb.  We abandoned the efforts for a few months.  We later determined that \u201cSmilodon fatalis\u201d was a worthwhile climb that actually traversed into the base of the meat of \u201cCongolindination\u201d.  Unfortunately, the upper section of Congo\u2019 moved back into loose and scary rock.  After some deliberation, it was determined that if the route merged with Racer X near the top of both routes, the best climbing from the original route could be had, while giving modern climbers the best possible finish. Cheers to Dave Anderson and Bruce Carson for their vision of the original route and Cheers to the modern climbers who get to enjoy what is offered today. Aug 24, 2020",

Quite nice! P3 looked pointless, it's literally 15' long. Bolting: PG13 for sure, but kinda typical of older slab routes. #3 worth bringing for the crystal pod. When you're on P2, the route to the left looks a bit more bolted and chalked up, it's a 10c and I'm guessing it'll be more popular soon since it seems more closely bolted. Traverse: Starting P2 often has a traverse depending on what route you take for P1. We took Index Archeology, and then had maybe 20' of leftwards traversing, but it's decently well bolted (better than up top). When the leftward traversing bolts stop (after 3 or 4 of them), look up, and you'll see the (not very obvious) #3 crystal pocket. The rock looks pretty black and not as clean as I'd expect, so it took me a while to determine that was actually the way up. As mentioned, the 10c Argentinosaurus to the left looks cleaner, better bolted, and frankly a bit more appealing, but that's not your route (although they share the same anchor at the top).

The \"Variation\" is actually a completely separate climb. The original Compound W climbed to a tree anchor that was above the leftward anchor. The anchor on the left is where the good climbing ends and is the closest to the original line. The Variation was led from the ground up from below the rightward small roof section and the anchor placed decades after the original Compound W was established.

Stem up this corner.  Hanging belay anchor is above this corner. 2'nd pitch 5.11b (takes bolts and gear) - Climb directly up from the anchor.

I was pulling the last hard move before clipping the 10th bolt (if my memory serves me correctly) when a key hold blew. I think that normally a fall from that point would be clean, but because it was a hold blowing I was spun sideways in the air before hitting the wall 25+ feet below. I'm pretty sure the climbing just below this point is fairly easy so there is a longer space between these bolts then most bolts on the route.Perhaps 15 feet or so. Once you pass the easier climbing you have to pull one more tough move before clipping the bolt. A fall from here while clean, will probably send someone for quite a ride. As I learned the hard way. There's nowhere to put natural protection in at that point. I'm not sure if this changes the grade of the climb or not, as I was simply climbing the most obvious line and the funnest looking move. Although I am fairly certain that this section is probably more difficult now. Either that or there's a nice incut now. The place where the hold came off is visible in the photo taken from the top of the 3rd pitch. Climbers right of the bush. Probably wouldn't hurt for someone to head up and assess the pitch at some point. I'd be happy to do it but unfortunately I'm going to be outta commission for quite a while now.

I certainly hope your recovery goes well. I had a similar event happen on Prusik Peak many years ago. My partner and I put alot of time into getting this route developed and made every intention of making it safe. Unfortunately loose rock typically exists to some degree on all routes even after hundreds ascents. Heck, I even pulled off a loose hold on Godzilla several years ago. This is especially true on newer routes. However, I believe that Walking Legend has very little loose rock on it due to the extensive amount of time cleaning we spent on it. If I recall the area you fell in, I believe there is a way around to the left of the hold which broke on you which will not affect the grade. I think that was the way I went when leading on the FA. As far as the distance between bolts in that section - previous precedent at Index is not to place a bolt in a 5.8 section of a 5.10 route where a fall will not result in serious injury or death. I certainly hope this does not discourage people from trying this amazing route. Nov 24, 2015",

Though it is commonly done in 5 pitches, all of the pitches are very short (some less than 30 feet). The original rating on this route was 5.8, but is now an Index 8+. In Leavenworth, this route would easily be rated 5.9+ or 5.10A.To approach, just cross the tracks, go slightly uphill, and trend diagonally right to the closest wall. Look for the obvious fist-crack and start here.Pitch #1 - 5.8 - Jam\u00a0up the hand-crack which turns into tough flared fists at the crux. Belay on the ledge. 25 feetMove your belay over to the base of the finger-crack on the climber's right.Pitch #2 - 5.8 - Jam\u00a0or lieback up the thin fingers to tips crack in the left facing corner. Scramble up to the base of the squeeze and belay at the fixed bong. 70 feetPitch #3 - 5.8+ - Wrestle and grunt your way up the vertical featureless superslick flared squeeze chimney. This pitch is often wet. Remember to remind yourself that it's only \"5.8\". Belay on the ledge above. 40 feetPitch #4 - 5.8 - Climb the crack up to the roof, then hand traverse to the left with beautiful exposure. Turn the corner then jam\u00a0the hand and fingercrack to the big anchor. 70 feetPitch #5 - 5.7 - There are 2 options for this pitch. Consider the left one, which is much better. Scramble up to the tree, then angle up and to the left towards the arete. Look for 2 bolts above you. Fun balancy slab moves bring you to the anchor at the top of the wall. 90 feetDescent: Rap the Great Northern Slab route. Only 1 rope needed.",

We opted to rap off of the fixed belay station at the base of the chimney directly over the ledge towards the parking area (as opposed to back down pitch 2 to avoid knocking rocks onto ourselves) instead of continuing on as we weren't sure what condition the rest of the route would be in.

It is important to note that the Index Town Walls guide book by Kalman and Van Biene include Libra crack (5.10a) as part of the original Pisces route and therefore rates Pisces a 5.10a.It used to be possible to climb the 5.4 corner above, and just left, of Blockbuster before traversing left past an arete to the base of the crack. However the blockbuster boulder was pushed off the wall with a hydraulic jack presumably for safety reasons. The remaining wall is no longer commonly climbed and the Blockbuster route is gone forever.",

Execute a hard mantel over the roof (v4?) to gain 3 more bolts of easier low-angle climbing (5.11). Traverse right into the slab crux of Terminal Preppie, clip a bolt (use a runner), and keep it together through the runout to the final crux roof of TP. Be wary of where the rope is running while pulling the final roof. Bring a long sling for the microcam/nut used to protect the roof on TP in order to keep your foot from catching behind the rope should you fall. There is potential for a direct finish straight through the roof above Pretty Vacant, however there is a body-sized chockstone in the final crack, and I wouldn't want to be any part of that beast coming loose, intentionally or accidentally. Potential danger aside, the direct finish would certainly be a more logical conclusion to this route. Aug 20, 2021",

The original first bolt still remains so that others can attempt to climb straight up to the \u201cdish\u201d you mentioned if they so desire, but this line appeared improbable during my time on the route and the comments on this page suggest that others have had similar difficulties. Traversing in from Terminal Preppie does not seem obvious, natural, or safe. Traversing in from Sonic Reducer would set the leader up for a large pendulum, and is unnecessary given the presence of holds near the start of Pretty Vacant. The new bolts follow a natural line of dime edges that trend toward the first roof of Pretty Vacant. This naturally leads to the original second bolt (now the 4th bolt). Given the discussions I read on here, I wrongly assumed this was the start that was \u201cslightly left\u201d of the original first bolt. However, I believe the new bolts allow for safely leading this high-quality slab route ground-up. The line that these bolts follow is independent of Sonic Reducer, and the bolting is up to the same standard as the other routes on the Sonic Slab in terms of spacing. The body sized block is not on Taurus, but instead is in the crack that goes through the roof straight above Pretty Vacant (about 10-15\u2019 to the right of Taurus). Aug 25, 2021",

I wouldn't go out of my way to climb it, but it's a good warm-up/transition climb between Rogers Corner and Terminal Preppie. After having folks from >6ft and <5'8\", we gave it a 5.10d grade.  It's easier for taller people and harder for shorter people and the 10d seemed to be an average.  If one feels 5.10c is the grade they would tell their friends, I would not consider it sandbagged. As a fun side note, and purely my opinion here, I recently climbed in Joshua Tree on 3 climbs: Gem, Colorado Crack and Spiderman.  All 3 had similar sections of poor rock as \"Strength\" but the climbs have high ratings/recommendations.

Climb easily to the first bolt, then ponder the first crux:  an insecure friction sequence to nab a good jug below the roof.  Undercling right and power over the bolt-protected roof (5.10 if you do it right), then balance up to a short crack/flake.  Place a small wired if you want, or run it out to clip the first bolt of a fantastic three-bolt crimping sequence on matchstick to half-inch edges.  The highly technical ultimate crux comes at the last bolt, starting off a good stance, which is good because it might take awhile to decipher.   Ah, but it's not over!  After a moderate runout (good holds will appear), sidle up on a flake below the final roof and place a small wired (good placements).  The final 5.11 crux pulls the roof on thin jams to a bomber rail, with a welcome horizontal hand crack at the back.",

Set up a TR by pulling through Sonic Reducer which worked well.

I would say 12b/c for the initial moves and 12a for the upper crux.  Didn't have time to give a lead go. Can't wait though. Really nice free climbing addition to the wall and significant bump from SR for someone 5'. I'd have to agree with Tom R that the FFA reserves prerogative to create Free version name, and its silly to think the original aid name needs to used in all circumstances. Safe to say naming usually has something to do with the first ascent party's personal experience; and since free climbing is certainly different enough from an A0/5.10 ascent.. it just makes sense that a newer name reflecting the Free ascent should be an option if warranted .  It doesn't erase history but does add to it IMO. Oct 26, 2020",

It's possible that some ascents have climbed to the right after the roof to take advantage of a full rest on Iron Horse before moving back left to establish on the arete; although not totally straightforward, this reduces the difficulty as it allows one to start the easier Powerhorse sequence fully rested and chalked. If climbed directly without the jaunt right into the rest, the moves are harder and the route feels far more sustained. In any case, the climbing is a remarkable mixture of power and finesse, difficult nearly the whole way through. Temperature and humidity are both important considerations when attempting the route even if your granite technique is absolutely flawless.The extension to the original route continues above the anchor over the roof past one bolt to a more logical finish at an anchor on a large ledge. The original anchor has now been moved higher to just under the upper roof, making what was originally a crux section of the extension part of the shorter version.

It was a little scruffy when I climbed it, but someone had cleaned it somewhat recently and it was still possible to at least toprope it clean. From the anchor atop Japanese Gardens P2 move left and up to a short, thin crack. Even though I remember thinking some gear might go in before you commit, the business starts without any fanfare and on lead the crack would be a scary, desperate lieback above a ledge with a hard-to-clip bolt near its top. The route then climbs over to and up onto the face of the Stiff Kittens Flake and follows a seam/crack to the top of the flake. I remember this section being low-to-mid-5.10 face climbing and it appeared quite runout. Another option would be to just finish Stiff Kittens, which would omit the worst of the runout. I know that at the top of the flake I stepped left and down and finished on the Stiff Kittens slab, so I don't know if there is an independent finish directly above. I believe if it were scrubbed the route would at the very least be a fun toprope option, say after doing Japanese Gardens to the top, Stiff Kittens or maybe even from the top of TPMV P3 if the final bolt works as a directional.",

The bolt would similarly be hard to clip and its status is unknown at this juncture. The upper part of the route is pretty runout; I don't remember seeing much potential for gear but it does follow a seam or crack of sorts so there might be something. Another option as stated above would be to climb the rest of Stiff Kittens which has good gear. There may or may not be an independent anchor for Cheeseburgers, but I remember stepping left--again on MiniTraxion so take with a grain of salt--to finish on the upper Stiff Kittens slab. In any case this route would probably need a mandatory scrubbing and inspection, including the bolt, before attempting a lead.",

This classic easy aid crack at one time had the distinction as the hardest crack in America when Todd Skinner freed it in 1986. It has a storied history of free ascents and attempts. Hugh Herr, a double amputee who used prosthetics that he designed and fabricated, completed a free ascent. Chris Schlotfeldt completed a pinkpoint ascent (pre-placed gear) in the late 1990s. Mikey Schaeffer made the first redpoint ascent in the contemporary accepted style in 2006, meaning he placed ALL his gear on lead from the ground. Start via a bolt ladder that leads to the base of the crack. The crack is consistently difficult until it relents at the top, although a left-jogging section above an undercling is particularly challenging.P2: (.10b) The oft-climbed approach pitch to Slow Children can also be accessed via Godzilla. Thin stemming leads to crack and ledgy face climbing and an anchor on a ledge below the initial corner of Slow Children.P3 and P4: Apparently, pitches 3 and 4 of City Park can be free climbed at moderate grades (.10, 5.9+). The belay for pitch 3 would be to the right of the belay for Slow Children, but I'm not sure. Another option above Slow Children is the excellent Tommy's Sandbox, a fine .11a outing with nicely varied climbing.",

Crux moves even protect with a purple mastercam (just like Slow Children).  Bring a green c4 to protect the move entering the finger crack. Pitch 4 (11d): has some slabby moves followed by a finger crack to an left-arching seam.  The seam (and crux) are protected by a mix of bolts and pins.  The hardest moves have a bolt at waist to chest height.  However, because of the arching nature of the route, you can't cheat through these moves.  Be ready to crank hard through the slabby boulder problem.  Over the last couple of years I have periodically brushed the route to keep it clean so it will always be safe and straight-forward.  The route dries quickly after rain.  One thing to beware of however, is a crux sloper seeps through the winter months.

At the top of the flakes, follow a chalked-up ledge traversing left and then straight up the corner all the way to the belay (bolts). The pitch is long, so don't give up on the anchor, it is there.    Avoid the temptation to finish at the \"Nobody tosses a dwarf\" anchors, which are partway up the final corner, just a little to the right. If you do this early exit, you miss some fun, relatively easy corner climbing. Instead, continue until the corner ends at a large comfy ledge.

We had to do an awkward traverse left to get back into the correct crack. The description says it, but just to reiterate, to stay on route, take the LEFT crack from the ledge for the second pitch.

Watch rope drag though, I placed something before getting to the traverse and should\u2019ve back cleaned it or put a double length runner on it. Drag wasn\u2019t terrible but definitely noticeable. This route also has the distinction of being my first ever big fall (or any fall for that matter) on gear! After the traverse getting back into the finger crack corner I placed a foot badly on the chalk caked rail and slipped (it was also like 90 degrees) took a nice clean fall on a .4 and just giggled about it. Made better choices with footwork the second time around and it was fine. I agree with Korrigan that the upper portion of the first pitch has some areas I would rather not fall in, including right before the anchors. The second pitch felt way harder than the first to me personally. I\u2019ll have to go back and do it again in better conditions but I\u2019d almost be tempted to just skip it compared to how amazing the first pitch was. Sep 11, 2021",

Godzilla still feels physically harder to me but Princely is more of a mental exercise. Rope drag can be totally heinous on the last 1/3 of the climb if you don't plan ahead. Rope drag tips: - Have your belayer stand about 15ft climber's left from where you actually start climbing. This will reduce the angle the rope makes going through the first draw on the bolt. Some of the pictures on this page looking down the pitch show exactly why this is important. - If you feel compelled to place any gear before the first bolt (which is pretty high off the ground), consider downclimbing and back cleaning all of it after clipping the bolt (maybe use a locking draw). - If you have DMM revolvers, put one on a quickdraw on the bolt at the start and another on an alpine draw at the start of the leftward finger rail traverse. These help a ton at those big direction changes. - Like others said, avoid putting gear in the crack way out right after the rightward traverse before starting the leftward rail traverse, or at least back clean that piece before continuing. - Extend extend extend! Resist the temptation to clip any of your cams directly without at least a quickdraw. After the finger traverse, pay attention to any gear placed in a concavity that need a full 60cm sling to avoid pinning the rope to the next bulge. Sep 20, 2022",

Shorter folk will get an extra thrill on the traverse under the roof, as you may not reach the undercling to use for balance. Gearwise, I find that placing a #3.5 in lieu of clipping the chockstone inspires a bit more confidence for the wide section til you can get a #4 at the roof.  A #5 is bomber for the chimney and a few .75's and #1's are nice in the upper handcrack.  A single #3 was sufficient but you could probably place another if you bring more. Jul 28, 2012",

I recall doing the direct moves back in 07' after futile efforts to do the Lynn Hill stem solution on MW (most likely due to my lack of frontal plane hip flexibility). \u00a0At the time, I gave the direct a lead by climbing up to the eye bolt on MW, back down to the ground, and then climbing over right to the direct start...eventually falling and swinging way left to slam hard into the wall. I recall the climbing being brilliant but the fall absolutely terrible. \u00a0I'm certainly not a fan of squeeze jobs and unnecessary bolting, but do believe the distance between the original MW line and Supermodel allows adequate breathing room. Moreover, the climbing is just SO awesome!! \u00a0I would imagine the grade is all over the place depending on body composition, skill, flexibility, height etc. \u00a0Felt like Index 5.12c to me. \u00a0The direct now has 2 bolts.

The first 50 feet of true start still had not been freed and was one of the most obvious remaining challenges at the Lower Wall.When I got on it for the first time, I couldn\u2019t do all the moves but I could see that it would go, and was surprised that no one had done it yet. The holds and the sequences are quite beautiful...pure Index, but on another level from what I had been on before.It took about a year of getting on it here and there till I saw how it went and could link large sections. After an easy intro, the main part of the climb is only 25 moves, but 25 moves of tricky and hard vertical granite bouldering, with some classic Index funk and consistent bad feet. I linked the crux 3-move boulder for the first time this winter and knew then that it could go at any point.I decided to add 2 bolts to be consistent with how the rest of Ten Percent is bolted, and started to make attempts on lead. After 15 or so attempts over a few months, including a couple falls above the crux, I sent on a cool and dry spring evening, likely one of the last good days before the summer heat.This route could go gear only, but it seemed way more fun to not have to wiggle in stoppers, take massive, awkward, and possibly dangerous falls on them, and then wiggle them out to make another \u201cclean\u201d attempt. Somebody could surely do it...they will be way more badass than me. But now people can go free ground up safely and focus on enjoying the moves on one of Index\u2019s best routes.After a few difficult boulders, the route breaks hard right on a line of crimps with bad feet to the ledge below the low anchors on Japanese Gardens. You could probably go straight up and avoid the ledge, but this seemed contrived. And instead of continuing up the 5.11+ climbing on Ten Percent I decided to end it short. It didn\u2019t seem to fit the nature of the free variation to lengthen the pitch.I\u2019m suggesting another name for the direct free variation, \u201cEn Passant,\u201d French for \u201cIn Passing,\u201d because it resonates with \u201cTen Percent,\u201d and because I think the reintegration of the direct start deserves a more interesting name than \u201c10% Direct.\u201d The crux clocks in around V10/11, and you can fall in other places as well. I think it\u2019s a solid step up from Amandla (5.13+) in difficulty and is likely\u00a0Index\u2019s first 5.14.",

Pull the bolted roof (crux?) and follow a finger and hand crack to anchors atop the lower town wall.Adding this to the 3 pitches below makes for a great stretch of climbing with each pitch ~ 2 letter grades harder than the one before.This pitch should get done a lot more, and it needs the traffic to keep it clean.From the anchor of Tommy\u2019s Sandbox, traverse skiers left to the anchor for Park Ranger. A 70m easily gets you back to the Slow Children anchor. Rappelling from the Tommy\u2019s anchor is a rope stretcher and not recommended.

The original aid version of this route had 5 pitches (5.8 A4). The free version really only has 4, as the original second pitch is best combined with p1.\u00a0P1 (Original): Formerly the last remaining bit of aid on the original TPMV, this section was free climbed recently at 5.14-. See neighboring entry \"10% Direct (En Passant)\". This is also an excellent C1/2 climb and in years past was often used as a place to practice hanging belays and setting up hammocks/portaledges. \u00a0For many years there was a two bolt anchor about 40\u2019 up to facilitate aid practice.P1 (Japanese Gardens to TPMV): \u00a0This pitch is most often done as a standalone climb by beginning on P1 of Japanese Gardens and then stepping left at the first (short) anchor. The rest of the pitch follows shallow corners and cracks past 3 bolts and gear to another anchor (.11+). \u00a0P1 (Extended): Climb the Japanese Gardens P1/TPMV linkup as described above but keep continue past the anchor. The section above consists of a difficult height dependent bouldery section protected by good but small gear (.12c-.13a). The gear must be placed well, otherwise the fall onto the P1 anchor is fairly substantial. As such, it is a mandatory strategy if free climbing to climb this as one pitch from the ground. This extension is basically the old \"Chopper Flake\" pitch 2 of TPMV; see \"History\" for more information about the flake.P2: This was actually P3 of the original aid climb. Climb cracks up a RFC to a comfortable ledge. \u00a0From there face climbing angles left to an anchor below the obvious corner start of the slab pitch (fun 5.10-, slightly runout).P3: Fantastic, challenging pitch of slab and corner. Traverse left and up from the anchor and do a committing and slightly scary move back right to clip the first bolt. Continue up the difficult corner via bolts and gear, then follow the left-trending dike until you can step right to a ledge with an anchor via runout 5.9 climbing. Alternately, continue up the dike and over the roof to join Newest Industry. This pitch can also be approached via P1-2 of Japanese Gardens and is well worth the trip either way (.11b/c).P4: This pitch climbs a slab past a bolt and some gear to a tough little mantle past a bolt. (5.10d) Cracks then lead near the anchor on top of Newest Industry, but 10% continues on via three slab options: a) climb out right and then up over some overlaps to the anchor (5.8). At one point there was a bolt and a pin on this variation. b) continue straight up past 2 bolts to the anchor. This variation has the best protection (5.9). c) an easier variation with less protection climbs to the left before arching back to the right to the anchor. It should be noted that a fun alternate finish that joins Japanese Gardens can be climbed by following a ramp up and right to join JG on its last pitch (5.11).",

Please Note: there is 3\" ledge just below the first anchor that is possible to tag with a heel or toe if one whips from the crux.  On one of my falls I didn't have quite the clearance, and smashed my heel smack into the small ledge, which didn't feel that awesome after sailing through the air for 15'.  Beware. That said, I didn't use any small cams.  I believe I protected the crux with a micronut.  If you decide to place a cam instead (which will definitely work), there is less room to use the crack pocket for your fingers. Yesterday I was up there and noticed the extension bush and greenery have really grown back.  Fortunately, this area is small.  Perhaps I'll head back up and do some cleaning soon. Also, don't let the grade intimidate.  It was one of those really hard to gauge routes.  While the crux is potent, it is relatively short lived and balancy to boot.

Well-bolted slab climbing grows in difficulty until a distinct, thin crux section. After the crux, there is a much easier runout either right to an anchor on TPMV below its 10d mantle pitch or to a higher anchor via a dike and easy roof. Natural gear protects the dike and the moves over the roof. The crux of the route is infamous for being rather thin for the grade, especially during the warm season. Descend from the anchor above the roof or better yet continue to the anchor at the top of the TPMV/Japanese Gardens routes via 5.7-5.8 slab climbing for a full size pitch.",

                "route_description": "This version of Free at Last from the new guidebook is a bit of a rework that combines pitches from the original full Tatoosh, Free at Last, and Voyage of the Majestic Glass Eyed Tuna.  This route is packed from top to bottom with varied, thought provoking crack climbing that will force you to pull on your thinking cap.   Pitch 1 (5.10b, 35m): Start up the modern version of Tatoosh (well documented here:  mountainproject.com/route/1\u2026).  Instead of belaying at the normal anchor for Tatoosh under a large perched block, continue up 10 feet of dirty terrain and belay off a tree.  Alternatively, split off about half way up, climb up the original pitch two of Tatoosh and belay at the anchors of WATWB/Just Say NO2.     Pitch 2 (5.9, 35 meters): This pitch is the lowest quality on the route due to some mandatory dirt scrambling, but it still has a good bit of fun crack climbing.  Head up a clean, low angle V-slot, with a thin crack in the back.  Hike up some dirt and climb some creative sequences up cracks in the corner to the next belay.   Pitch 3 (5.10b, 35m): This pitch has quite a few cruxes and felt more sustained than pitch 4, but it's all there.  Begin by heading up the corner to the first crux at the obvious roof.  This is definitely harder than 10b if you opt to burl through it, but there are some sneaky tricks to it.  A good stance above the roof separates the next crux, which will require even more creative thinking.  Once at the base of the overhanging ice cream cone feature, head up and left to the third smeary slab crux, protected by a bolt, and finally up and right along an easy ramp to the belay.   Pitch 4 (5.10d, 30m): Just when you are getting used to the funky crack movement, this pitch slaps you in the face with some hard face climbing past two bolts.  We were a little confused by the bolt placements here.  Start by mantling into a little boxy ledge and clip the first bolt, then climb straight left to a blocky crack.  I placed a red metolius here to protect against a pendulum as I moved up to the next bolt, then reached down and pulled it out after clipping.  Continue up to a right leaning crack and then to the base of the imposing V-slot.  This slot is the real money climbing of the route, but I would HIGHLY recommend taping up to get the most enjoyment out of it.  At the top of the slot, clip a bolt and make a few last moves up and right to the chains.  Give your thanks to Saint Francis before heading down!   Descent: Rappel the route with a 70 meter rope.  It works best to use the anchor of WATWB/Just Say NO2 for the last rappel, which is climber's right of the couple trees at the top of the first pitch.  The rappel getting there is a rope stretcher.",

After the initial hard moves, stand up on the ledge. There is a critical black totem/blue metolius placement high above the ledge here to protect your follower. Continue past the main corner to the awesome perch atop Natural Log Cabin.\u00a0Pitch 2 40\u2019 5.10- Head straight up off the belay, clipping 2 bolts. Then traverse right past one anchor to the anchor at the top of P2 of NAD. It is possible to link with the first\u00a0pitch if you manage your rope drag well.Note: There are many other ways to reach this point. I\u2019ll describe a couple more recommended variations.\u00a0Option A: Climb Shirley (5.11) and traverse to the top of P1 NAD then climb P2 NAD (awesome 5.10). This is the most recommended variation as it tags the classic, under-appreciated P2 of NAD.\u00a0Option B: Climb Thin fingers (or Tatoosh or Quarry Crack) for P1. Then make a moderate traverse clipping strange glue ins to the belay atop P2 of NAD. \u00a0Pitch 3 80\u2019 5.10d\u00a0\u201cP3 NAD\u201d\u00a0Climb the awesome techy right facing corner up to an athletic roof. Good hand jams take you out the wild roof into a short awkward but easy fist crack. This leads to an hanging belay in the flare above. If you have the energy, it is possible to link into the short next pitch.Pitch 4 40\u2019 5.10\u00a0\u201cThe Cleft\u201d\u00a0Head up easy chimney to the roof, then make an awkward transition into the OW on the face above. Solid and friendly splitter 5\u2019s takes you to a sick belay on top of Narrow Arrow. You can get a BD .1 in just before the roof to back up the 5 as you bump it the rest of the pitch. A single 5 allows for TR pro the whole way.\u00a0It is possible to rap from here with a single 60M rope. One long rappel takes you back to the top of NAD P2, then two more from there to the ground. If descending this way it\u2019s definitely worthwhile to climb P2 of NAD on the way down if you didn\u2019t climb it on the way up. \u00a0Pitch 5 120\u2019 5.10a Climb \u201cHigher Learning\u201d to a belay below the last pitch of \u201cFree at Last\u201d.

Alternatively, you can climb the bolted direct start of \u201cThe Path of Righteousness\u201d to gain the same corner crack.\u00a0From here you can rappel or top out and continue up the mid walls Squamish Style.",

At the time I don't think anyone else around had the frame of mind to do it.

Climbing to the first bolt is a little spicy, but not terrible.  There are 3 pieces of gear that are all pretty good before the bolt.  If the risk/reward to the first bolt just isn't worth it to you (the climbing to the first bolt isn't that special anyway), another safer option is to warm up on Godzilla trailing a separate rope and on the way down stick clip the first bolt on The Cabin. A blue TCU makes the spaced bolts in the bottomless corner feel much more approachable.  But the fall is perfectly clean if you forgo the TCU and take the whipper. The route has 2 sets of anchors -- one for the original route (right) and one for the left variation.  I prefer the original exit and this anchor is atop a large comfy ledge, which is nice.  The left anchor is about 10 feet lower than the right anchor - just below the large, comfy ledge.  One downside to the right anchor is it puts the rope in-line with a rope-sized crack that I've gotten my rope stuck in (easy to fix with minimal shenanigans).  I've done the route with 2 different 70's -- both barely got me to the ground from the left (and lower) anchors.  If rapping from the right anchors with a 70 you'll have to do some easy down climbing.  Tie knots or use an 80!! Another quick word of caution - its probably better to rap from this one.  If lowering (from the right anchor), you may get your rope stuck in the crack and you may be stuck in space. Jun 18, 2016",

I was hunting and pecking around for something to finish the day, and stupidly asked per what the deal was with the cabin. Right now it\u2019s late and I\u2019m going to bed soon, so maybe I\u2019ll come back and do this story better justice, but for now I\u2019ll tease anyone who gives a rat with the basics. Per squinted up and exclaimed something profane about the addition of a bolt at the roof. Before I knew it, I was balanced on tip toe, trying desperately to thread several kinds of stopper wires through a hole in the rock, basically tickling the bolt with my cheek, moments from a ground fall. If memory serves, I couldn\u2019t get any of the loops to punch through the hole to make a threaded anchor, so after five or ten minutes I caved and clipped the shiny thing. Now that my nerves and ankles were fried, I launched up into the lay back, with one piece at the bottom and nothing else that would slot in the feature. I remember being dead certain that I was going to die at one point, but per and reed were screaming at me with blood and fire, so I borrowed some of their conviction and decided that if death was coming for me, it would darn well find me climbing upward. Fast forward a while\u2026it\u2019s basically dark, the goons on the ground have shouted themselves hoarse, every sequence since the opening has been an epic, and im stuck between feeling incredibly lucky to be as far to the top as I am, and just plain lucky to be alive. I\u2019m pumped out of my gourd, I can\u2019t find the hold to get out of the \u2018cabin,\u2019 and my foot starts slipping. As I fall, I stick my hand out blindly, and it finds the hooded edge I\u2019ve been searching for. The next fifteen seconds of layback/jam/grovel/whimper-shrieking was the hardest I can ever remember trying. I more or less rolled onto the top. I don\u2019t remember anything else about that night, except for getting the impression that I\u2019d generated the best bit of entertainment ol per had had in a hot minute.

Next climb Shirley into the hand-jam pod below the crux stemming on that route.  Reach left and clip a bolt out on the arete, then down-climb until both hands are on the jug flake on the left side of the Shirley pillar.  From here, climb up and left into the oblique dihedral past two more bolts, encountering two distinct boulder problems on the way to the NAD ledge.     I found this route to be a bit harder than its neighbor, Narrow Arrow Direct, but not as hard as the Narrow Arrow Overhang.

I heard David has stopped climbing ( I am still using clothing and a pack he made for me almost 30 years ago) but Cal is still going strong at least as of January when I last saw him.  Cal pretty much single handedly built the trail from the Country to the Upper Wall.  Before that was built the trail to the UW started near town and followed a line directly below the waterfall.  He also built the Mid Wall trail.  His route Centerfold was maybe the first Upper Wall route conceived of as a free line. May 27, 2020",

This pitch features excellent arete climbing, and some cool bouldery sequences. A very good line!Plenty of ways to skin this cat, but here's how we originally climbed it:1. Climb Cry Baby2. Clip bolt, step around left to other side of arete3. Climb easier terrain on the left side of the arete for another bolt or two.4. Step right back around the arete when you can stand on the pretty good footholds on the right face.5. Layback the right side of the arete to the big jug at the top.I've heard  that folks have tried it staying  on the right side the whole way... That would be quite a bit harder. Not even going to hazard a guess at the grade for that.Two notes: 1.) easily toproped from the anchor of 12 Gauge, or probably BCB. Incidentally, also a good way to get the rope onto the anchor of either of those climbs (though perhaps harder than 12 Gauge). 2.) Do be careful with the rope when you step left around the arete. The climbing out there is much easier than the rest of the pitch, so you probably won't fall.

Also it's displaced off into the bushes to it can't be reached from the Gorilla ledge.  The tree anchor is still solid for rapelling down to the ledge or to the bottom of the cliff for a descent, so coming down it's all fine but unless that hand line gets replaced, this isn't a useful access route up to the Mid Wall right now.  It's a true cliff and dirty to boot, so there isn't a clear way of getting up it without a good solid line, and even then a hand line may be sketchy and insufficient. The Seamstress route (5.7) which is lookers left up trail of the Winkie Dinkie Cliff is dirty but solid and a pretty quick approach.  The route description is accurate, and it's about a 50-60' climb in total depending on where you start.  The top anchors are 1. a bolted chain on the inside of a slab of rock at the top of the route, and 2. a burly tree that's been slung by climbing rope with hard points.  The blue fixed line was getting cut by the edge of the rock, so it was scrapped at some point but then later tied into the 2 anchors to extend it out closer to the top and around the rock edge.  Even with it's BFK master point, it's not redundant so faith would be resting in the solid nature of both anchors.  Recommendation is to add a separate personal anchor for the belayer and an additional attachment point from the belay device to the belayer as a form of redundancy if you're going to hang your belay device out on the extension.  The quality of that section of rope appears fine though and not aged or worn, core intact. I wouldn't, however, use this as a rappel.  Better to double back and head out to Winkie Dinkie Cliff if no one's climbing it. Sep 3, 2017",

It looked to be much harder going straight up the corner. Of course, it is possible that someone else did your direct line, but Darryl, the person who generally gets notified when a new route goes up at Index, hadn't heard about it. Why don't you give it a name and rating?  Why not add the route to this site and mention that it was lead before Flippo? Ditto for any other routes you've done that aren't in Sky Valley Rock, RCNW, or some other site that publishes new routes. The story on Flippo is that it was cleaned off several years ago by Darryl and another person and then top-roped. They didn't have the time then to bolt it. I went there with Darryl recently, recleaned it, and added bolts. I imagine that you probably wouldn't have even considered the lead if the route hadn't been cleaned off before. Cleaning at Index is hard work! I don't recommend that anyone chops the bolts. At Index, if a route doesn't get done regularly, it gets covered in moss and dirt and the whole effort is wasted. And maybe with your line publicized, the first two bolts that it shares with Flippo will give it more traffic, which is probably what you want.

First time I tried this about five years ago I couldn't even get into the dihedral because there was nothing for hands.  Now there are great finger locks and good (but small) gear. I just lead it for the first time on Thursday after having TR'd many times.  The chimney which is much easier than Butt-lips on Aries was my concern on gear.  I just had to get my head around it and go.  It took a #5 but I wish I'd had Geoff's #4 too.  Jerry followed with approach shoes he wants to take to the Bugaboos and did fine. This route is no harder than Timberjack, the upper pitch of Magic Fern, or Aries/Lizard so yes, I think it is a 5.8.  It is easier than Toxic Shock, Wet Dream and Battered Sandwich and Plumb Pudding which Geoff agrees is a 5.9.  It has great variety and fun moves - I'll keep coming back. Jul 21, 2013",

Recent rains have re-deposited a bit of dirt in the finger crack but not enough to render it unusable--I scraped out some with my nut tool but that section will likely need more attention after the wet season to keep it in such nice condition. I had only a #4 for the chimney which made it feel a little heady (a #5 would have helped, as the #4 was tipped) but it sure is fun --climbs more like an offwidth than a true chimney and facing toward town gives you more options.  While the chimney is much more enjoyable than Butt Lips on Aries, I would not call it 5.8.  Closer to an honest 5.9, in my opinion. The moves into and through the dihedral were also good.

The roof can be made safe with some 1/4\" to half inch cams. But save a few of those for up higher too. I think the true crux is 15 feet above the roof where all the holds vanish for a while and you have to do a long side pull, gaston in a wide runnel. I actually got a chicken wing up there. Small cams are essential there also. So yeah, bring all your gear. Super fun route! We were up there Labor Day, 2017 and saw no one all day...and it's shady.

Be dialed with your gear off the ground because the terrain is bouldery and difficult, and stopping to place gear in the first 15 feet is very strenuous and insecure. This route needs constant care every season because it is a low point in the cliff where a lot of water, dirt, and plant life accumulates during the wet months.

While maybe a .12 somewhere else, I think 11d is very fair for Index and none of the 3 boulder problems feel harder than V4. As of now, after the last bolt, the thin crack running along the final slabby corner to the chains cannot be protected until the dirt gets cleared out. When it is cleared out, a small brass offset or a red (maybe yellow) ballnut should easily protect the insecure move to get established into the corner. A fall after the last bolt, however, is unlikely if you've managed to get that far. I'm pretty sure you need a 70m rope to get off, there didn't seem to be too much excess rope after I rapped which makes me think this pitch is around 32m or so.

Start in the same hand crack as for Hips and Valleys, but instead of going up the chimney, go up to the right in the shallow corner and continue up the face via stemming and some delicate features over a small roof and to the chains for Robin's Ramp.   It is also possible to go up the chimney for Hips and Valleys and cut in above the crux for a much easier variation and is easily TRed by doing Robin's Ramp. The crux may seem a bit contrived due to the proximity of Hips and Valleys, but bolts were placed where sound rock could be found which was quite close to Hips and Valleys.",

I was up in early August and there was a second, lower bolt with a red ribbon so I stayed off it but was glad to see it on the list today so we gave it a go! (good job with patching the 2nd bolt hole btw, I thought I was going crazy and misremembering a second bolt until I finally spotted the patch mark) IMO placing an excellent #1 in the rooflet crack and then pulling the mantel-y dual finger crack moves is the way to go.

Bring your A game for this one! So incredible, packs a punch for it's height. Careful with the start before the bolts, options for pro if you look. Edit 5/30/21: Main crack seeps mud onto the rail at the roof crux after a hard rain, rail and bottom of crack (where you need to put gear and finger jam) was totally caked and still wet even the 2nd day after rain. Scrubbed, dried with chalk, repeated a few times to make it climbable. Scraped out another few inches back of dirt out of the upper cracks (also got a few stubborn roots out) so hopefully less mud will seep out the bottom in the future. It's short but has rather slippery feet throughout, and perhaps because of my beefier fingers this feels so much harder than Pressure Drop to me. May 22, 2021",

Why, you might ask? Take a seat pilgrim, and bear witness to the tale I am about to tell.\u00a0Does the name Spaced Man Spliff sound familiar, yet you can't quite place where you've seen it before? That is probably because at one point there may have been another route in Index by the same name, though if it ever really existed its location has long since been lost to time and the failings of human memory. The only evidence that it may or may not have ever existed lies on the back of the Index T-Shirt, an iconic symbol that has come to represent the almost cult-like reverence held for the Index Town Walls by all who have spent time in its ethereal forests and on its proud granite walls.Made by Richard Ellison, a Seattleite and old school local climber, the back of the Index T-shirt has a checklist of what at first glance appears to be the crag's most classic climbs. Upon further inspection however, there are a handful of routes that don't make any sense; the main one of which is Spaced Man Spliff. I was on a quest to complete the entire list; a feat that had never before been accomplished, so I needed to track it down. I had looked in every guidebook that had ever been printed about Index and found no record of a climb by that name, so I asked Rich about it. He had no memory of what this mysterious climb was (if it had ever even been). I posted on the Climb Index! facebook group for leads \u00a0and got a few rumors, but nothing concrete. I asked many of the OGs that had been climbing at Index for many years; still nothing. Eventually I concluded that it was something I would have to create myself in order to complete the T-shirt list. It didn't need to be a classic, not everything on the list is; it just needed to exist.\u00a0Finally I narrowed my remaining climbs on the list down until Spaced Man Spliff was one of two remaining (the other being Davis-Holland, which was to be my last). I had found this line while working Young Cynics, skipped over by the other developers of the Wall of Voodoo; perhaps for good reason. It was buried deep under a thick layer of typical Index vegetation, but a bit of scraping revealed a crack underneath. From the ground it looked quite promising.\u00a0Unfortunately the climb didn't end up being all that great, with a short boulder problem crux protected by bolts, and easy gear climbing above and below. In the end that might be fitting though, because the next person to try and complete the T-shirt list will probably have to find it all over again under the ferns and moss that will inevitably reclaim it just like I did. Half the adventure of completing the list is getting off the beaten path onto things one wouldn't otherwise climb, or even know about. Better yet, perhaps they might just put up another Spaced Man Spliff of their own that is a little more worthy.",

From there it joined up with the DGS route.  The Back Road route description isn\u2019t consistent with following the DGS to the top. (Larry Kemp once told me he started the Back Road from where the picture shows and then could not follow the route to to the top.) But the route description gets closer if you start up DGS p2 and then traverse right to a ledge. Directly down from the right side of this ledge is an overhanging corner with a fixed pin.  This corner is much harder than 5.8/9.  Above the ledge hollow flakes lead up to an overhang. There are rap slings below the overhang.  Above the overhang is a big ledge with an anchor.  Jon and I place this anchor and cleaned off the ledge.  If this is the \u201cBack Road,\u201d then the original route farmed up a crappy gully to the top.  Instead of climbing the gully Jon and I climbed a nice 5.8/9 pitch up an ar\u00eate that joined the variation finish on DGS.  We found no evidence of previous climbing above this ledge but lots below it.  Free climbing from the DGS to this ledge appears be much harder than the claimed rating.  In addition the hollow flakes look like they would have been mentioned in the description.  Lots of loose rock in this area.  Jon made some special tools to help clean this section but after our fun time on the Golden Road I was nervous of creating a monster. 35/40 years ago Terry told me he climbed \u201cThe Back Road\u201d many years earlier and it was a dirty worthless grovel.  He couldn\u2019t really remember details other than the route was terrible.  The only thing that seems to come in at that level of difficulty in the area is the DGS. Conclusions: DGS was climbed many years ago possibly by many independent parties and the current guide has the wrong FA.  (the p3 variation was put up recently) Gunstone and I substantially cleaned the DGS p2 &3.  A very large amount of loose blocks were removed.  This is partly why I was apprehensive about cleaning around the hollow flakes.  Most likely the Back Road followed the DGS and the Beckey description was simply wrong.  The other less likely possibility is the Back Road followed the hollow flakes up to the overhang and the rating was off. Jun 4, 2020",

Pitch 1:  Climb the first pitch of Jungle Fun/Tempituous to the belay.  Much better climbing than appears from the ground.  5.10 - bolts.   Pitch 2:  Follow the bolted flake as for the start of pitch 2 of Tempituous.  After the second bolt, trend left and follow flakes and a featured face to a belay stance.  By using slings, this pitch can be linked with P1 for a monster 180 ft pitch (20 draws). 5.10 - bolts and 1 medium nut between the second and third bolt.   Pitch 3:  The final pitch climbs through two fun 5.10+ bulges/roofs to a tenuous traverse left.  A two bolt boulder problem through the main roof with 250ft at your back guards the chains.  This pitch is still a little scruffy, but the climbing is good.  5.11+/12- bolts and a blue and yellow tcu protects the moves to the first bolt.   Descend by lowering from the top pitch to the top of P2.  Two raps from the top of P2 get you to the ground (100ft and 70ft).  Rap anchors have been installed in the plumb line under pitch two.

We left the #3 & #4 at the top of pitch 2, and if we did it again would also leave the second #1, and #2. Below the BD 0.5, we had doubles of Metolius which came in handy! and the last pitch was only bolts. rapping went smoothly, and we were barely able to get down from the top of pitch 2 all the way to the ground with our 70m rope!

The 4th pitch is one of the most unique pitches I have climbed in Index... or anywhere for that matter! Some of the face climbing was a little sandy and gritty from lack of traffic, maybe? Regardless, a worthy outing that you can session from the same first anchor as Heaven's Gate. It is really easy to climb either route, and rap to the other's anchors mid-route to try some of the pitches. My partner and I climbed Heaven's Gate, rapped down to the P1 anchor, and tried out this route. It made for a great try-hard, finger tip-sanding outing! All this being said, be ready for a quintessential Index sandbag. It is listed as .11 here and .11- in the book, the latter of which is... well, so very Index. My partner and I both felt it harder than advertised. Get on it and draw your own conclusions! For the most part, thoughtfully bolted, with some of the terrain demanding you commit and trust that the bolting is the way it is for a good reason. Some additional details (beta warning?): P1: Lamplighter: [not much more to say than what has already been said elsewhere] P2: Very interesting face climbing above the blue lichen that is trickier than it looks from the belay. The boulder problem above is weird, and technical, and the exit to the anchor barely lets up. Get bouldery and creative. My guess: it clocks in as a sturdy V4. P3: Surprisingly adventurous and requires some good problem solving, especially if you encounter the route as we did, with no real previous traffic hinting at how to climb it. Engaging face climbing above your bolt gets you to the gear-protected section. A single rack was nice to have to get to the chains. P4: THE pitch of the route. The first bolt is odd, being below the height of the anchor. Clip with a longer draw or consider skipping it and having your belayer use a fixed point belay in case you punt the moves to bolt 2. The crimping at the start is incredible on white patina. It leads to another challenging boulder problem. The real joy comes with the traverse above. It is improbable and so cool when you figure it out. The terrain above is easier, but still engaging, airy, and exciting. Verdict: Check your ego at the base and get on this thing! The fourth pitch will not disappoint. And the whole route is a great \"schooling\" in steep granite face climbing. Sep 10, 2022",

The extension to the second anchors is maybe the most fun climbing I've done at Index (though seems like it's rarely done; had to pull a ton of ferns out of the crack to make it climbable). There definitely are a few scary looking bolts, though. One in particular looks very bad (fortunately the bolt just after it is a 1/2\" stainless beauty). I think you'd be okay if you fell on the bad bolt and it didn't hold, but it would be scary. Aug 15, 2022",

Some root-grabbing at the end.P3-P4 (much better variation finish): 5.9. Traverse out right on the exposed ramp about 30' (takes gear). Belay at the bolted anchor.

If you are up for a little bushwacking and the feel of a FA, this is right up your alley! We climbed this yesterday and it was among the dirtiest routes I've climbed (outside of the desert). This route is a truly a diamond in the rough, so long as you can get past the endless spiderwebs, moss, lichen, and foliage. The granite was wonderful, the movement was very fun, and the rock was solid! My partner and I finished on the original P3, which was very short, but still enjoyable. The route is fun, with good jams, and takes mostly hand sized pieces. I didn't place a lot of nuts or small gear, but singles from Tips-#4 Camalot will give you plenty of options. Doubles in the handsizes (.75-#3) are recommended for the 45-meter second pitch, on which I was glad to have brought a #4 camalot. DESCENT can be made with a single 70M rope. Rap from a tree with tat above the final 5.7 pitch or the chains located just left of the 5.9 variation top-out, down to the chains at the top of P2. From P2, rap about 25M to a tree directly below. From the tree, Rap to the climbers right towards the chains at the top of P1. Finally, Rap P1 to the ground. Take care when at the tree rap as there is a large, mini-fridge sized block that is loose and ready to come off. If you're an upstanding steward of the area, you might bring along a brush and/or a broom and do a little cleaning to get this gem into better shape. GO CLIMB THIS! Aug 25, 2016",

Well-bolted and deserving of \"classic\" status. Some details: - P2: Punchy boulder problem at the start. Definitely an Index .11a. The terrain after is incredible: sustained crimping following a dike for 30 meters! Nothing matches the crux in difficulty, but there is no giveaway all the way to the belay. - P3: A nice break from pitches 2 and 4, but still engaging in its latter half. There are a couple of ways to climb the end that will change your experience of the pitch. - P4: Granite roof climbing. It will feel rather hard for the on-sight attempt, and the pitch gets progressively harder the higher you get through the second roof. The difference between my first and second time up the route felt VERY different when I knew which features were good and which were not. Save some gas for exploring your options. A moderate, airy finish is the cherry on top for this pitch! - Verdict: If Index .11s feel hard for you, this route is a great challenge. Good bolting and high-quality climbing make the quintessential Index experience approachable for those climbing/trying multis at the grade. Sep 11, 2022",

Honestly, I thought the hardest moves on the route were on P2, and the move I came closest to falling on was a reachy one on P1 at the little rooflet, which may be harder if you're shorter. 2. I actually think P3 is better if you just do the big traverse left then back right at the start. It's easy to back-clean the first bolt from the second, and voila, no rope drag. Done this way, the hardest moves are at the end of the pitch, not the start, which IMO makes for a better route. Not sure what Matt/Greg's original vision was, but I think it's likely they envisioned the traverse method. If they intended to go up, I think they would have put the first bolt in a better spot to do so. 3. As of 10/3/22 all the bolts are in great shape except for the rusty old buttonhead Kerwin mentioned on P3. P1 was a little scruffy, but fine to climb without a brush. P2 and P3 were immaculate.

A few more face moves (protected by medium-sized gear) lead to a 5.10 mantel and comfy belay ledge.

At only 40 feet, this pitch is certainly sustained at the grade. Belay on a large ledge that forms part of the descent and traverse pitches on the original Davis-Holland route.

An easier section in the middle takes a small to medium sized nut before bolts appear again and the difficulty begins to ramp up. Suffice it to say that with relatively few ascents, just where and what comprises the crux is somewhat debatable, but it is most certainly in the vicinity of the last few bolts. For me at 5'7\", there was a reachy move from nebulous, bad holds around the second-to-last bolt, followed by a high-step maneuver that seemed as though it should've been easy but wasn't. One attempt made me throw my shoes in the bushes nearby while the next saw me redpoint, so it probably comes down to minutiae and the vagaries of tricky \"steep low-angle\" climbing.

To take advantage of the aforementioned insurance, bring a green or red C4 and a few small to medium nuts along with the 12 quickdraws.

Coupled with the steel bolt, the aluminum corroded preferentially into a dangerous wafer cake of metal that, as a good friend of mine learned, wouldn't even hold body weight. After hanging on the third bolt about 60-65 feet off the ground the hanger peeled off, sending him flying. The next hanger broke as well and all of a sudden, the ground was coming up fast. His belayer must have reeled in some slack from this one, because the first bolt is certainly less than half the height of the third. Somehow, the final bolt caught his fall and the result was a chipped elbow bone from hitting a ledge on the initial section of the climb. The bolts have since been replaced, but the remnants of the old hangers are still there to teach us about an important metallurgical property known as galvanic corrosion. Jan 13, 2012",

The 2nd traverse pitch 12a feels very exposed as you galavant up above the golden arch pulling on an assortment of positive crimpers and potato chip flakes arcing through lovely orange granite. This pitch has a couple nice balance sections culminating in an awkward compression reach before romping up the finish arete' feature that can only leave you smiling.  There is still a belay chair which most will not use.  Climbing with Dan I followed the crux pitch which almost felt harder than leading it.

                "route_description": "This route is a linkup of existing routes with a little bit of new ground to allow passage up the center of the Upper Town Wall. You can now access some excellent 5.10 climbing on Rise and Fall and Green Drag-on without having to climb 5.12. The pitches listed below can be combined in a variety of ways depending on what you are looking for.    Pitches five and six are bouldery and have really fun movement. Big thanks to Alex and Cody for playing around on this route with me!   Pitch 1 - 5.9 - 90 ft  Climb the 5.9 start of Davis-Holland with fun jams and fingerlocks. This pitch is sometimes wet. Belay at two bolts on a nice ledge.   Pitch 2 - 5.10a - 100 ft   Continue up Davis-Holland, stellar fingers and thin hands in a corner. To a two bolt anchor on a sloping ledge.   With a few back cleaning shenanigans the 2nd pitch of Davis-Holland can be combined with the next pitch which yields an amazing 55m pitch of 5.10 climbing.   Pitch 3 - 5.10c - 100 feet - 8 Bolts  From the belay look up and right for a lone bolt with a black painted hanger. Undercling across the roof, per the right variation of the Davis-Holland, and then step right to a perfect jug under the bolt. Execute a short trickey section which yields a horizontal (#2 camalot) and some moderate face climbing to get onto the second pitch of Rise and Fall. Skip the belay out right and clip another black painted bolt up and to the left.    Follow amazing crystal edges up a dike passed 6 spaced bolts. This is the second pitch of Rise and Fall. The crux comes at the end getting past two different roofs. Belay at a good stance with three bolts.   Pitch 4 - 5.10d - 75 feet - 2 bolts   Start up Rise and Fall passing one bolt until you reach a finger crack. Get some gear and step right below a bolt that is on Green Drag-on. Clip this and continue up to a two bolt anchor under a roof. (This is the end of pitch 3 of Green Drag-on).   Clip the anchor for pro and make a hard move to get established in the steep crack that exits the right side of the roof. Sustained 5.10 crack climbing leads to a stance on the left with two bolts. This anchor is not setup for rappel, so if you want to bail you need to aid up and left on Green Drag-on or climb the next pitch and rappel Town Crier. It is possible to split this into two 40 foot pitches but there is no reason to do so and the P3 anchor on Green Drag-on is fully hanging and an awful place to belay.   Pitch 5 - 5.11c/d - 40 feet - 4 bolts   Climb up the corner with some thin gear to a good jug. Clip a shiny bolt out right. (The bolts above and to the left are for Green Drag-on) A balancy section leads to a tenuous second clip. There are holds, if you look in the right places! Keep working right with a powerful section past the third bolt. Clip the final bolt and step right to the three bolt anchor on Town Crier.    Pitch 6 - 5.11d - 105 feet - 2 bolts.   Start up the flare on Town Crier and clip a few pins that can be backed up with thin gear. Execute a sweet layback sequence (crux) to get established on a flexy flake. Crank past the flake, 2 bolts protect, and then immediately start traversing left on an obvious horizontal crack. (Going up further is the 5.12+ crux pitch of Town Crier)   Twenty feet of sweet jugs bring you back to the Green Drag-on. Follow the final 50 feet of 5.10 crack climbing to an anchor on a busy ledge.    The #3 is useful for the last pitch but everything else above #.75 is not necessary for the last two pitches.",
                "route_location": "This route starts on the Davis-Holland and finishes on Green Drag-on.   There are many ways to rappel. I suggest going down Green Drag-on and then swinging left to Rise and Fall  (clipping a bolt as a directional helps). I prefer this way since it is very very hard to rappel to the Green Drag-on Anchor under the roof. A 60m Rope is sufficient.    You can also rappel down Town Crier with a 60m rope.",

Thought it was pretty spectacular, some notes for future suitors: 1) Linked 2nd pitch of DHLA into the 10c bolted pitch up the dike as described above.  This was quite the pumpfest, and rope drag could have been improved via more/longer runners around the transition between the two routes, and on the middle couple bolts on the dike.  Placed a #1 C4 after the first bolt off of the DHLA second anchor (which is after the lieback sequence off the belay).  Crux felt to be the first of the two roofs, while the second is still slightly cryptic. 2) The right facing corner on the 10d pitch felt was extremely strenuous.  While the gear is great, it is not as easy to drop it in and go like most of the other climbing at Index. The bottom of the dihedral was slightly wet after 3 days of sun but created no issues. You can easily avoid the slime/water. The corner after the intermediate anchor can be protected well with a single rack to #2, you'll probably want blue and purple Mastercam sizes for the lower and upper sections of this pitch. 3) The 11c traverse pitch with three bolts is **** awesome!  I put it a .5 and blue X4 in the pod that can be seen from the belay, before the first bolt, and felt well well protected. 4) 11d pitch - This flare seems harder than Iron Horse, but the sequence up and through the flake is great.  The gear on the traverse is finger size and a bit manky - plug and go!  Up above, the 5.10 cracks were nearly unprotect-able due to the amount of goo filling them.  I dog-legged back right to the intermediate anchors on the last pitch of town crier, which required some unprotected down climbing across the grassy ledge and shenanigans for my follower. Highly recommend everything on this climb other than the last pitch of town crier due to reasons listed above. Mar 20, 2016",

Link it into the .11d pitch. The final 2/3 of the .11d pitch (now back on Green D) is a very filthy 5.10 crack (sadly it's a seasonal gutter for the upper wall) that never sees traffic and has a lot of zigs and zags. Next time I'd probably just finish by using the Town Crier bolt ladder to AO directly to the bolted anchor. Aug 21, 2017",

Although it technically has 6 pitches, most only do the first 3 and either rap from there or continue up Lovin' Arms to the top of the Upper Wall (this combination is also very classic).P1: Jam up a handcrack (sometimes a little wet when the rest of the route is dry). Upon reaching a ledge, wander over right and then back to your left on small terraces to reach a bolted belay in a right-facing corner. 5.8+P2: Jam and/or lieback the crack up the right-facing corner to another bolted belay. 5.10aP3: Climb up and right from the anchor, around the roof, then back left into a right-facing corner (another variation goes directly out left around the corner past a bolt, but the moves are very balancy and potentially harder than the route's original crux). Climb up the corner past a crux with delicate footwork and small holds to a bolted belay on a ledge. Rap from this belay (or continue on Lovin Arms). 5.10cInstead of rapping the route, it is wiser to rappel 25m to a 3-bolt anchor directly below the P3 anchor. \u00a0Then either a double-rope (55m) rap to the ground or a couple more 20-30m rappels trending climber's left via anchors on the sport wall.",

We didn't have time for Lovin Arms, and rappelled straight down in 2 rappels (double rope). A conservative rack for this climb would be nuts (including thin), double set of cams from fingers to #3 Camalot, with 1 or 2 extra green Camalots for good measure. Jun 8, 2007",

If you look at his photo you can see the bolt studs to the left and right that our venerable forbearers placed in order to aid across the blank space between Good Girls and Abraxas.  If you had climbed the route before 2014 you may remember the ribbons of moldering webbing that were slung between the 5 bolts of that aid traverse.  This served as the defacto belay for the start of pitch 4 which by way of it's position reduced the hardest climbing on that pitch at the start to an awkward aid move from a crappy and unnecessary hanging belay on the blank wall just after leaving the relatively comfortable stance in the corner a few feet below.  Lame.  Although you can still belay from higher up the stance in the corner is much more comfortable and it forces the climber to actually climb the route and the belayer doesn\u2019t get an ass hat when they fail. It\u2019s also possible to aid across at the Starfish and gain the flake you can see in the picture.  Just sling that lovely Asteriidae.  It won\u2019t mind.   Consider the Starfish.  Brass is the metallurgy of traditional climbing.  It weathers well.  It's nice to look at.  It serves the same purpose as the three aid bolts and shit piles of old webbing it replaced.  Maybe even better since it offers not one but a quintuplet of tie offs or sling positions.  Patent pending. No one is stopping Mikey or anyone else from responding to his call to arms to rush out and CHOP CHOP CHOP all the \u201cnew and unnecessary bolts\u201d.  In case you\u2019re interested I assume he\u2019s referring to all the 3/8\" stainless bolts and Fixe hangers I used to re-bolt pitches 1-3 in the fall of 2013.  I already removed most of the \"new and unnecessary\" hardware that was placed in the 90's(mostly 3/8\" sleeve anchors in an alarming state of decay).  20-30 year old plated sleeve anchors found in Index are total crap and should not be trusted in general.  I \"wrench tested\" and left a few bolts here and there at the anchors to make belays and transfers more efficient and comfortable.  Personally I wouldn\u2019t whip on those things but they\u2019re great for positioning or clipping crap to.  Most of the belays are semi hanging on this route.  If one were a big time mountain chap one might be able to recognize and appreciate the utility of this thought unless perhaps ones reason were clouded by some unknown bias.   He\u2019s NOT referring to the scores of other random rusty junk all over the route or even the totally botched half drilled and slung bolt sticking out of pitch 4.  On those items his persistent whining is uncharacteristically absent.  The anchors, bolt count and clipping positions are the same as they always were.  Don't believe the hype.  Oh yeah, I also scrubbed the living shit out of the entire route top to bottom. So yeah, It's good to go Kerwin.  At least for now. I didn't bother with pitch 4 because honestly it just didn't appeal to me.  It starts up directly enough but then takes a hogs share of the rock by traversing left for like 60' or 70' Wtf?  My motivation to update the lower pitches was driven by the desire to find a more direct finish to an otherwise 5 star route.  Did that.  Two pitches straight to the top in line with the rest of the route.  As good as it gets.  Duh.  It's Index.   I guess it could be called a variation of Good Girls or Upper Abraxas.  I've taken to calling it the Starfish bypass but \u2018Mikey likes it\u2019 has been gaining in popularity.  Maybe an amalgamation of the two? It starts from a new anchor just after the hard climbing ends on P3 of Good Girls(11c).  The last pitch is 10 or 11ish and was done on gear for the FA but honestly who the hell wants to drag up a bunch of wedges on an otherwise fully bolted sporto for that?  I'm going to finish bolting it this spring.  Rap straight down with a single 70'.  Maybe a 60' but I don't know because I don't own one. Mar 5, 2016",

If the starfish was actually on a different pitch I\u2019d probably care a lot less.  But you are staring right at it while climbing. And if you go back and read my post the only bolts I mentioned that are unnecessary are on P4 which are the bolts you placed for your variation.  Your assumption that I am referring to the bolts on P1-3 is clearly wrong by my specific calling out of the bolts on p4.  The place where I have problem with your bolts is where they actually cross the original P4.  The bolts are right in the middle of an an existing pitch.  More thought could of been given to where these bolts should of been placed to not interfere with an existing climb.   The upper part of your variation pitch looks quite good and is a very natural finish to p4.  And the final pitch you established looks good as well.  I have zero problems with the sections that you bolted that are on previously un climbed terrain.  My beef is adding bolts to an established line that already had adequate bolts and was the original line. Your statement that all the clipping stances are the same is false.  You clearly moved some of the bolts which is obvious due to the presence of the old bolt holes.  Same goes for a couple of the anchors.  The changes were minor but they were indeed changes which I feel weren\u2019t improvements.  I found a couple of the new bolt placements harder to clip as they were higher.  I could reach the original bolt placements from the good holds but couldn\u2019t reach the new bolts from the same stance.   Taller people probably won\u2019t even notice these changes but both me and my partner did. Thanks for the hard work you did replacing the old bolts.  In the end I just hope more people get on the UTW.  It is a woefully under appreciated asset for Washington climbers. It\u2019s too bad that you take all of this personally and feel the need to resort to personal attacks.  The discussion would be better served if we debated the specific actions and facts instead of our personal characters. Mar 19, 2016",

In case anyone doesn't remember or know, the starfish is in the same location as what was once a hanging belay/horizontal aid ladder that crossed between GGLBB and a flake off to the left.  Possibly Abraxas.  This hanging belay was a total crap pile slung with many generations of rotting, knotted webbing.  It was also in a ridiculous position, right in the middle of, and directly below the crux moves of P4 of GGLBB and offered total lack of even a soup\u00e7on of a belay stance.  Interestingly it did however offer a convenient justification to simply reach through(aid) the hardest move on P4 which if blown could easy result in an ass hat for your partner. So I have to ask again, why would one reach out, grab and or step on the starfish?  Did the old belay offer the same temptation?  Do bolts?  Chains?  It still serves as a way to aid across to Abraxas if that's your thing.  If it helps, we could call it a memorial plaque.  I got a list of dead homies.  Anyway, ultimately it serves zero purpose other then perhaps offering an option to move left at that point and an unconventional way of tidying up the old, redundant aid ladder/belay. I'm 5'8\" in height.  Probably just under the national average for an adult male. I tried, yesterday to see where the bolting would be more difficult for a climber shorter then myself.  It was unclear.  Maybe we use different clipping beta.  Could you be more specific Mikey?  The belay that I added for my direct finish was put up in a full down pour and I decided yesterday that I didn't really like the position and plan to move it.  I'm always happy to revisit any bolts that exist.  Placed by me or otherwise. Jul 7, 2016",

There are a lot of bolt lines that leave madsens ledge and head up (with more being added at the time). The start of the route is located just to the right of the golden arch, look for two bolt hangers that are nearly horizontal with each other and a trend of bolts that angles up and slightly right before trending left to a two bolt anchor. There should be a two bolt anchor below the bolt line that you can belay from, but it tends to be a bit wet. An alternative belay can be had by placing gear in the horizontal cracks slightly higher up on the ledge above the two bolt anchor. Jul 18, 2016",

A two-bolt anchor lies on the left side of the chimney on top of a small ledge.P2: 5.10a, 5.10c A0, or 5.11c, depending on how you go - The original route, with a single bolt for aid if you traverse right from the anchors. Pulling on a sling brings you to a crack system; these moves go free at 5.11c.The more common way is to continue up the chimney for about 20 feet then follow a crack on a ramp that goes down and right to a shallow corner. Done this way the pitch is overall 5.10a.Either way, from this point continue up a crack in a small corner until some large solid holds become available, then rightward and upward to a mantle onto a large ledge and the anchors.P3: From the anchors climb up the quartz-like face, past one bolt, to some cracks that will take gear. Hand and footholds are numerous but many are downsloping. Continue directly upward to the anchors, or bail out leftward into the pine trees. This pitch probably deserves an R rating.For descent, you may rappel the route with 2 60m ropes, use one of many rappel options to climber's left, or walk off easily.

P3 - Random easier face/edge climbing, and is easily linked with P2. If you only have a 60 meter rope, there is a decent way to rap off the upper town wall using both the Heaven's Gate and Golden Road Anchors: -Walk climbers left over to the top of Heaven's Gate (The anchors are a little hard to find, but but it is the second bolt line from climbers left of the main chimney/corner; the anchors are down one ledge, past a small tree, then anchors are below this ledge/tree on another ledge at the edge of the wall). -Rappel straight down 30 meters to next bolted anchors on Heaven's Gate (you will be at the ends of your rope). -Rappel down 30 meters to the very ends of your rope and pull/walk yourself ~30' over to the anchors on Golden Road (the anchors are not very visible until you are near the ends of your rope, and you will be at the last 2-3 feet of your rope to reach the anchors; there is little to no rope abrasion when pulling/walking yourself over if you position your rope properly). -Rappel to next anchors on Golden Road. -Rappel <30 meters to a ledge 15 feet off the ground (ropes will be out of sight down an overhang). -Scramble down off of the ledge after pulling your rope. Be aware!  These are full length rappels on a 60 meter, so if you are unsure of your rope length, walk off instead (or bring a 70 meter or double ropes). Aug 24, 2009",

Great line, and, with the chimney variation on P2, quite a bit easier than Davis Holland. Taking a suggestion from the Davis Holland comments, we brought 4 green .75 Camalots, and were able to place most or all of them on almost all 6 pitches of DH/LA. I thought the first 20 feet of P1 was the crux of LA. There were some scary blocks directly above the belay in the chimney version of P2. P3 was Type I Fun; I trended L near the top and found plenty of good protection and no loose rock. We were happy to walk off L on a very nice trail system marred by a short section of illegal Jeep track.  When in doubt, stay L on the walk-off; other options lead you either back into Deliverance country or drop you too low on the UTW approach trail. Jul 29, 2013",

Well then boy do I have the right route for you. This route follows the first 2.5 pitches of Uptown High Rise before splitting off right before the 5.11 crux on two bolts of 5.7 to finish on a few fun moves of 5.9 reminiscent of Princely Ambitions. Doing the route this way keeps it at a fun moderate 5.10d with ~250 of sustained quality climbing. and one easy rappel back to Madsen's. The first two pitches can be easily top roped by following the Via Ferrata to the top of Madsen's Ledge.Pitch 1 (5.7, ~40 ft): Climb up the short fist/arm crack. Almost every move can be protected with a #3 or #4 (two 4s are nice to have if at your limit). Belay at the bolt above the crack, at the base of the corner, on gear, or sling the Via Ferrata to make an anchor near the corner (probably easiest). This pitch can be easily skipped by following the hand lines to the base of the Via Ferrata.Pitch 2 (5.10+, ~130 ft): Climb up the long obvious corner through 18 bolts to Madsen's Ledge - don't forget two for the anchor. This pitch is long, sustained, and harder than it looks, but features several great rests to plan your moves out. If you're running out of draws at the end, it should be easy to back clean a couple at the top.\u00a0Pitch 3 (5.10+, ~100 ft): Move the belay ~20 ft left on Madsen's Ledge to the base of a short steep corner crack. Place a cam and climb up the crack (#4 and 0.5 useful) then make an exciting move up onto the ledge (scary but safe with an attentive belay). Once on the ledge, climb up some face moves through two bolts and gear in between to a Thank God hand crack. Continue up the hand crack past the first set of chains through a 5.8 crack. Once through the 5.8 crack follow two bolts out right on easy jugs (~5.7) to the base of a crack/ledge. Follow the crack right and pull your way up to the chains. If you've done Princely Ambitions this should feel very reminiscent.\u00a0One rappel gets you to Madsen's Ledge and then you can downclimb the Via Ferrata to get back to the base.",

In reality, the route merely suffers from a well-known Index paradox: like most long Upper Town Wall free routes, despite the fact that Rise and Fall is amazing and was established in the 90's at a relatively modest grade, it saw few (if any?) subsequent ascents until the summer of 2010. With more traffic, the climb has been rediscovered as a classic. The alleged runout section on the 5.10- second pitch isn't runout at all; it seems bolts may have been added at some point in the past, or perhaps the information was suspect to begin with. Appropriately, the climb was named after an incident involving one of the first ascentionists and an unfortunate rappel off the ends of his ropes while descending the route. Miraculously, he limped away from the fifty foot ground fall and subsequent tumble with a mere broken ankle (and maybe a few ribs; story can be found in old Climbing or Rock and Ice magazine)! Anyway, here are the pitch descriptions:   (Approach via Green Dragon or Davis Holland)   P1: Climb the corner that comprises the second pitch of Green Dragon past four bolts before moving left onto a face. Traverse left with difficulty, then up a quartzite dike that leads to crux passing a roof. Liebacking and face climbing on the continuing dike leads to an anchor (.12a/b)   P2: Airy climbing up a dike leads past a roof and some really cool rock to another belay atop a small ledge (.10a). A short pitch, but fun and interesting.   P3: A fairly short pitch that packs a wicked punch; consensus is that this may actually be the crux of the climb. From the belay, climb right and up more quartz holds and some knobs in a corner to a crack lieback. Climb the roof above the lieback via edges and pull over onto a slab with a really tough and tenuous mantle. Get your magic toes ready and pull off another improbable mantle-like move and a few really thin slab moves before the difficulty relents and a belay is reached (.11d++).   P4: Climb a long and varied slab with some wild pockets (even a monodoigt or two!), roofs, bulges and a couple of thin crux sections (.11c).   P5: Climb overhanging, blocky rock to an anchor below the top of the Upper Town Wall (.10b). Loose in places; one of the bolts is in a hanging three or four ton block stack that vibrated when I sounded it out, so use caution. There is natural gear near the bolt if attaching yourself to it makes you nervous. Short pitch.    Either do another twenty feet of climbing to reach the very top or, more prudently, rappel the route.",
                "route_location": "Approach the route via Davis Holland P1 (a fun 5.9 varied hand crack and fourth class ledges) or via Green Drag-on P1 (a really cool 5.11- varied finger crack and fourth class ledges). Bring nuts for the finger crack option. Belay beneath a large right-facing corner with some bolts and a flake at the start. The approach pitches are a bit to the left of where the trail meets the Upper Town Wall.   Rappel with a single rope. 60m is probably adequate, but I think a 70m reduced our rappels by one or two.",
                "route_protection": "Mostly bolts, but gear is required on the approach pitch and some finger-sized cams are crucial for a safe experience on the rest of the climb. Aside from the first pitch, I used one small cam on each of the pitches except the second (5.10a) pitch. A singles rack from small to .5 Camalot size will provide good options for the placements. 16 draws, including some runners, were more than enough for us. For either of the approach pitches, hand sized pieces and a good selection of stoppers will supplement the smaller cams nicely. Doubles in finger size cams useful for the 5.11a option.   All the anchors are chain equipped, have at least two bolts and are in good shape.",

The route has afternoon shade.P1 - 40 m - 5.11+, 16 bolt. \u00a0If you just climb this pitch of Sisu you will not be let down. Pitch 1 is a tour de force of index trickery. Awesome knobs, tricky mantles and a bit of slab to keep you on your toes. Finish on Madsen's ledge at a chain anchor.P2 - 18 m - 5.10+, 6 bolts \u00a0From the anchor, walk right 20 feet and climb up a few boulders to reach the wall. The first bolt is way to the right of the line and should be back cleaned if possible. Traverse the horizontal cracks and then start crimping up and left to a belay.P3 - 15 m - 5.10+, 6 bolts. \u00a0Climb horizontally to the right under-clinging the roof/flake system. Eventually crimps appear above the lip of the roof and you can make your way to the belay.P4 - 25 m - 5.11-, 11 bolts \u00a0Start traversing to the left and then head straight up into the first crux. Catch a rest and follow the left leaning crack system past a few more challenging sections to a hanging belay.P5 - 10 m - 5.11+, 6 boltsA few tricky moves off the belay lead to a large flake. From here follow amazing edges up and right before hitting the final crux, getting to another hanging belayP6 - 30 m - 5.11, 12 bolts \u00a0Tenuous knobs and slopers give way to a fun flake system. Follow this, until faced with a knobby crux moving to the right. Follow crimps and features for a ways until you hit a big ledge. Belay at a double ring anchor.P7 - 35 m - 5.10-, ~8 bolts. \u00a0There are two ways to belay at the end of this pitch. If you have a 60m rope it's best to belay on the far left, at an anchor with huge chain links.

P2 has some strange granite puzzles and P3 has steep crack climbing. P4 crosses a band of rock resembling diorite or quartzite. The free variation is way cool too, but may expand your definition of what '.11+' feels like. When we did the route in '05 or so, there was a little bit of moss and lichen that made the holds feel smaller. A cursory brushing even with a simple Lapis brush and some chalk would do wonders for making the climbing more fun.P1 (Hard .11+): Edge and crank your way past two small roofs into a cruxy corner. Slightly mossy climbing finishes at bolted anchors on a ledge. Sometimes treated as a 'separate' climb because of its difficulty. 100'.P2 (.11+): Fun face climbing heads to the right off the belay through two distinct cruxes to another belay stance. This is the crux pitch but only if you skipped the first pitch by climbing in from Town Crier or Green Drag-On. 80'P3 (5.9+): Steep crack climbing leads to a large ledge (Smokeout Ledge). Gear to #3 camalot. 45'.P4 (5.10 A0 or \"hard 5.11d\", AKA .12b/c): A few A0 bolt pulls over a blank bulge access very interesting face climbing in a large band of diorite-like rock which end in a semi-hanging belay at a stance. 90'. Alternately, a free variation (.12c) starts to the right of the bolt ladder, crossing it at its 2nd or 3rd bolt. A crux down low leads to flat edges and a poor stance. A friction crux requiring some serious granite sorcery climbs out of a left arching corner and leads to easier climbing on the diorite-like rock above, rejoining the regular Swim route at the anchor.P5 (.11): This and the next pitch share the same thin and technical face climbing. They both are solid 5.11.P6 (.11): See previous pitch. This one may be a touch harder.P7 (5.9+): Bolted climbing up quartzite goes to the top of the wall. A small amount of natural gear may be required on this pitch.",
                "route_location": "This starts down and right of the obvious first pitch crack of Town Crier/Green Dragon, which is on a pedestal higher up the trail. Climb past two bolts to a stance at the base of the tough climbing.   A single 70m rope guarantees a no-frills descent. I'm pretty sure a 70m is required to rappel the first pitch with a single rope. A walk-off is also possible, but far less convenient.",
                "route_protection": "All bolts except for P3 and possibly the final pitch. Take 12-14 QD's including a couple of longer slings. Gear to #3 Camalots (maybe #4) is needed for P3. All anchors are fixed and equipped for rappel. As of fall '06, the bolts all looked pretty good.",

I'm only familiar with P1; all pitches, however, are bolted with the exception of P6, which is a 5.8 crack. The lower part of this route and others in this zone are often wet due to the waterfall until summer rolls around.   P1 (.12b/c) is a worthwhile goal in and of itself. It climbs an attractive black and white corner to the right of Swim and Green Dragon. Tricky, steep moves low in the corner are followed by pumpy overhanging climbing on sloping edges and pockets. Both angle and difficulty gradually ease on approach to the ledge/anchor. As mentioned in Blake's comment below, descent from the ledge via 70m is possible if done carefully.   P2 (.11-) is a bolted ramp.   P3 (.12-) is a sparsely bolted low-angled face.   P4 (.12b/c or .11b) either climbs the aforementioned arete straight-on or climbs higher up the corner and traverses back right, then climbs corners above.   P5 (.11) appears to be continuous 5.11 climbing through corners and aretes.   P6 (5.8) is a hand crack that requires natural gear.",

Short pitches and an easy descent (only one 60m rope required to rappel) make it very accessible for both aid and free climbing. Aid ratings and to some degree free climbing protection assume fixed gear is in place.   Pitch '1-' (.9): Not technically the first pitch of Town Crier, but accesses the ledge from which the route begins. Climb the hand and finger crack to 4th class ledges, trending right and belaying either at a bolted anchor below P.1 of Green Drag-on, or at a natural belay to the right below a chimney.   Pitch 1 (.9): Climb up the chimney to a crux move exiting the chimney. For the free version, belay at the first anchor (atop '12 Angry Bees'). If aiding, continue up cracks to another anchor atop 'Smokeout Ledge'.   Pitch 2 (.11c or C2+): The free variation climbs left to an overlap (crux), then up a scary hollow flake and thin cracks to a belay out right. The aid line either goes left out the roof (C2+ with possible pendulum point), or up thin cracks on the face (cam hooks and small nuts) to the same belay.   Pitch 3 (.12b/c or C2): The 'Triple Overhangs' pitch. Climb off the belay past fixed gear into a corner. Surmount the overhangs (.12 boulder problem or C2). If free climbing, exit left out of the corner when it starts to seem blank, then climb up and back right to the belay.   Pitch 4 (5.11a/b or C2): Climb a thin seam to a flare. Aid or free, the crux is the initial section off the belay.   Pitch 5 (5.12d or C1): Climb a flare off the belay (5.10 or C1). Fixed pins lead over a bulge to a bolt ladder. Climb the ladder (5.12d or C1) and belay at the second of two anchors. The free crux climbs a faint flared seam. Not all the bolts can be clipped when free climbing. It is also possible to free climb right of the ladder and rejoin it higher up with a 15-20 foot runout on difficult moves in horizontals.   Pitch 6 (dirty 5th class): Join Green Drag-on for a less-than-stellar finish to the top of the wall, or rappel the route.",

The approach handcrack will be obvious a little to the right on the wall. One 60m rope is adequate for descent, although a second would obviously make the rappels more convenient. Alternately, finish the final gully pitch and walk off up and left to meet the Upper Town Wall trail.",
                "route_protection": "Free climbing: Nuts to #9 Black Diamond; I found brass offsets or RP's to be useful, with doubles in the #3-5 range. A single set of cams from #0 C3/equivalent TCU's to #3 Camalot with doubles in the .4 and .5 range is more than adequate. Extra thin cams could be used, but aren't necessary.   Aid Climbing: Cam hooks, good nut selection with offsets, doubles in cams from thin to #3 Camalot and possibly a #4 would cover it, but please note that I haven't aided it lately.   If some of the pins were missing in certain spots it could change the nature of the climbing, but my impression is that the aid would probably still be clean, especially with modern gadgetry.",

The rap anchor halfway up p5 was missing hardware on one bolt, you should either bring extra hardware to re establish this rap station or you may need a second rope to rap. Aug 2, 2021",

This route features 6 varied technical pitches where you quest through unique geological features on mostly bomb-proof rock with sustained moderate climbing. The crux pitch features a ~25 ft section of 5.11 that can be easily aided making the route go at 5.10+/5.11a C1 for a fun, relatively moderate day.Pitch 1 (5.7, ~40 ft): Climb up the short fist/arm crack. Almost every move can be protected with a #3 or #4 (two 4s are nice to have if at your limit). Belay at the bolt above the crack, at the base of the corner, on gear, or sling the Via Ferrata to make an anchor near the corner (probably easiest). This pitch can be easily skipped by following the hand lines to the base of the Via Ferrata.Pitch 2 (5.10+, ~130 ft): Climb up the long obvious corner through 18 bolts to Madsen's Ledge - don't forget two for the anchor. This pitch is long, sustained, and harder than it looks, but features several great rests to plan your moves out. If you're running out of draws at the end, it should be easy to back clean a couple at the top.\u00a0Pitch 3 (5.10+, ~50 ft): Move the belay ~20 ft left on Madsen's Ledge to the base of a short steep corner crack. Place a cam and climb up the crack (#4 and 0.5 useful) then make an exciting move up onto the ledge (scary but safe with an attentive belay). Once on the ledge, climb up some face moves through two bolts and gear in between to a Thank God hand crack that leads to the end of this pitch.Pitch 4 (5.11, 80 ft): Starts with a beautiful 5.8 fist crack then slowly increases in difficulty to a series of thin technical balancy moves. Almost all of the 5.11 moves are protected by bolts. Skirt left around the imposing roof and work your way up onto the ledge to finish this pitch near a small tree.\u00a0Pitch 5 (5.8, 50 ft): This short 4-bolt 5.8 pitch is a nice reward after all the hard work on Pitch 4. From the anchor, make a move right and then follow the bolt-line up (don't get suckered too far right) the fin on a couple cool bucket holds. A #2 is nice to have at the ledge after bolt 4 before walking up to the anchor.Pitch 6 (5.10+, 90 ft): A long, winding pitch. Start in the alcove just to the right of the P4 anchor and work your way up to stand on the obvious hold. A small/offset nut is very nice to have to protect the next move getting to the bolt. Pull on the memorable mono pocket and then work your way up into the sloping right-facing corner/rail. Balance your way up the rail and make a couple thin moves on gear (0.2 useful) to reach a set of bolts and jug holds. Keep working up, placing gear in good pockets (sometimes hard to see - look up and right) until you reach the top. I like to sling a tree at the final crux - a cross-over/step left before reaching the top.",

It will need some traffic to clean up some of the crux sequences (rock was still breaking off in some of the steeper sections), but the climbing is VERY unique, consistently insecure, and hard. Partner and I thought it a bit of a sandbag, especially on the crux pitch. Multiple cruxes on the route seem to require very specific beta to feel like it climbs at the advertised grade. As a trade, though, the sport pitches are generously bolted. The one caveat is the descent. You can rap the route down to Madsen\u2019s ledge, but the anchor there was not equipped to rap when we climbed it (9/2023). We ended up going down the via ferrata for one pitch (in the rain) to an anchor station halfway down the crux pitch off to climber\u2019s right and rapped from there to the first pitch anchors and then to the ground. Perhaps we missed something? Overall a very cool route that is worth the new-route-grit price of admission. Maybe the route will clean up nicely, and I\u2019ll be proven wrong about the sandbag factor! Sep 22, 2023",

It's a pretty incredible piece of geology that just needs more people to climb it and spread the word so it stays clean. To answer your question on the rap from Madsen's Ledge - I intentionally didn't add a rap station there in hopes that climbers would descend the way you did. It's too far from Madsen's Ledge to rap straight to the ground with a single 70 and the other rappel station is offset enough sideways across the via ferrata that it didn't seem to make sense to rap there or else you'd be risking a hefty swing into the corner. I was also more worried that folks would accidentally try to rap from there with a single 70 to the ground and either get stuck or worse. I've done the short downclimb on the via ferrata in the rain before as well (I actually prefer the whole downclimb over rapping) and, while annoying, it felt safer than leaving open the potential of folks accidentally rapping into space from the ledge. If you're climbing at Madsen's I think it's safe to assume at least once person is comfortable with that level of downclimb and if you happen to be climbing with someone who's not, I've even lowered friends down to the ground from the Madsen's anchor and downclimbed myself after. Hope that helps. Oct 11, 2023",

Index has for years been an anomaly in climbing due to the high level of freedom we have.   Part of that freedom was because it was low key.  The way to keep freedom is to use restraint and not turn Index into one of the Exits. I used to get a lot of emails regarding route (still do occasionally) with people asking about adding bolts or pins to routes I have done.  I would invariably reply: Do what you want.  Why should I have any say over it? I still believe the FAs having some sort of control over a route is BS but seeing recent developments in MP and the increasing restrictions on simple hiking access in the Cascades I  have become pessimistic about climbing and more willing to offer my opinion.  I think MP is fast leading to more restrictions due to all the posting. Think about how many posts involve bolts, cleaning and so on.  Not just at Index but elsewhere.  For example, read the \"Beyond Redlining\" route entry and consider how land managers might interpret it.  Climbers are slowly killing themselves. Let\u2019s Go Crazy immediately to the left of Universal Language is a fun route too. Bolts do not ensure traffic I've put up dozens of routes that are bolted and never done.

The anchors are all just below the top lip of the wall.The cliff is actually only 100 feet from the UTW Top trail and when you\u2019re done climbing here, just head directly away from the wall down to the main trail. When you come back for more, you may find this way a little quicker.",

Protection can wander a few runners may be useful. Dryness or wetness is similar to the Mid Walls. Expect semi-moderate climbs on new terrain in the shade. The wall tops out just below Dana's Arch.

The area seems to have been largely neglected by climbers in part because of marginal information and partly over confusion on what sector is what. We cleaned and retro-bolted the west end in October 2018. Both sectors are separated by a five minute\u00a0walk along the cliff base.Approach as for the Upper Town\u00a0Wall. You will see a large white clean cliff through the trees just after the spur heading to the top of the upper wall and after passing \"One Bobcat Rock\" Most climbers will recognize the roofs and blocky gully which marks the eastern edge of the cliff band touching the UTW trail just before the last steep section leading to Davis Holland. You will see a rough trail left through a large patch of ferns approaching a very inspiring roof system. This is the Lighthouse.",

On your right will be the Little Elvis Buttress guarded by a series of small bluffs making it look impossible to approach. A newly installed handline on the far left side of the bluff gets you to the base of the wall.TOP ROPING:An excellent option is to rap into the wall. Rope soloists will like this. Approach as for Shady Lane West, once at SLW continue walking west 20 feet past the route \"Keg Stand\" look out left for a mossy view point which is the top of Little Elvis. Walk to this view point and look for newly installed rappel rings. Once may top rope Love Buttons, Cornered and Dirty Laundry.",

This route is somewhat of an Index rarity in that it is a straightforward, well-protected 5.9 sport climb.

Start by getting yourself onto the ledge at the base of the route - pull on a root and claw at the dirt or traverse in on face holds.   From the starting ledge, climb up the fun and juggy flake system past several bolts.  The crux comes right at the end as the wall becomes steeper and involves fun side pulls and a mantle finish to the chains.",
